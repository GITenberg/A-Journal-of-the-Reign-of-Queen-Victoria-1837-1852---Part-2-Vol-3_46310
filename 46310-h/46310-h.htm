<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>December 19th, 1846.</i>&mdash;On Thursday evening at seven
o'clock Mr. Grenville died, after a week's illness which was no
more than a severe cold or influenza. If he had lived till the
31st of this month, he would have completed his ninety-first
year. I had only known him with any sort of intimacy for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the last five or six years, during which I saw a good deal of
him. He was a remarkable man, not so much from great
ability as from a singular healthiness of mind and body and
the greenness of his old age. I never saw so old a man in
possession of such mental and bodily faculties; his only
infirmity was deafness; till about a year ago he used to walk
vigorously; he never had an illness till the one with which
he was attacked the year before last, and from which he
recovered entirely though with strength somewhat impaired.
His memory was remarkable; his cheerfulness, vivacity, and
kindness of disposition delightful. He evinced an affection
for his relations and a cordiality to his friends that were
pleasant to behold, and he was not only entirely free from the
moroseness and captiousness which so often attend old age,
but he blended an extreme suavity of manner and sweetness
of temper with the high-bred politeness of the more ceremonious
age in which he had flourished. He was certainly
the most amiable and engaging specimen of an old man
I ever beheld. I do not conceive that his abilities were
ever first-rate, and latterly (whatever may have been the case
early in life) he entertained very strong prejudices and often
very unreasonable ones; these prejudices caused him to act
in some instances in a manner inconsistent with the urbanity
of his disposition. He never could endure the Reform Bill
or forgive its authors; he never would set his foot in
Holland House after that measure; and he estranged himself
from all his old political friends, even those with whom
he had been the most intimate, not indeed absolutely quarrelling
with them, but desisting from all intimacy. He was a
scholar and a well-informed man, and he retained till the
last all his literary tastes and habits; he loved the society
of literary men, and to the last entered with zest and spirit
and unimpaired intelligence into all questions both of literature
and politics. It is difficult to say what the exact colour
of his political opinions was. He used to be a Whig; but
he was, at all events latterly, a moderate anti-reforming
Whig, with a horror of organic changes and not fond of
any changes, disliking free trade and disliking Cobden more;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
favourable to Catholic emancipation and the establishment
of a Catholic Church, but abhorring O'Connell who was his
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="nemesis">bête noire</i>, and in his eyes the incarnation of all evil and
mischief. He never was married, but when he was young
he was desperately in love with the Duchess of Devonshire,
and he never married because her image remained enthroned
in his breast, and he never could find any other woman to be
compared with her. For many years he was a poor man, and
he never became a rich one till the death of Lord Glastonbury,
who left him an estate and a great deal of money; the
estate, which was entailed on his nephew George Neville, he
generously gave up to him at once. He lived hospitably and
handsomely, and was, I am told, very generous and charitable.
His greatest expense was in books; he had collected a library
of extraordinary value, and which for the size of it has always
been reckoned the most complete of any private collection.
It continued to interest and occupy him to the last, and he
never ceased to add to it as occasion offered; he was, indeed,
one of the last of the great collectors, of the bibliomaniacs;
he collated every book himself, and placed in the title-page
of each, in his own handwriting, an account of the book, where
purchased, and its history when of any interest. His society
in latter years was restricted, and he was not fond of making
new acquaintances unless he fell in with them by accident,
when he was easily approachable and always disposed to
carry them on. He had constantly dinners and very agreeable
ones, and it was wonderful to see him at ninety years
old doing the honours of his table with all the energy, gaiety,
and gallantry of a man in the prime of life. A happier life
and an easier death it would be difficult to discover; his life
was extended to nearly a century without any intermission
of bodily health, any decay of mental faculties, and, what is
more extraordinary and more valuable, without any deadness
or coldness of human affections. He was blessed with
affluence, with the love of rational and elevating pursuits,
and with ample leisure and power to enjoy them. He was a
philosopher, a gentleman, and a Christian, and he lived in
constant social intercourse with the relations to whom he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
was attached, or the friends of his predilection, to all of whom
he was an object of the deepest respect and affection. A life
so tranquil and prosperous was terminated by a death no
less easy and serene; his indisposition was not such as to
interfere with his usual habits; he rose at his accustomed
hour and dressed himself to the last, even on the day of his
death. He had always a book, latterly the Prayer Book,
before him, and his mind was undisturbed and unclouded.
He dined and went to sleep in his chair, and from that sleep
he never awoke.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 20th.</i>&mdash;On Friday morning an article in the
'Times' announced that the Emperor of Russia was going
to annex Poland to his empire, putting an end to the last
vestige of Polish nationality. Yesterday morning the
'Chronicle' declared this report was exaggerated, if not
erroneous, and that all that was contemplated was the abrogation
of custom-house regulations between the Russian and
Polish frontiers. The history of these contradictory articles
is this: On Wednesday at the Cabinet dinner Palmerston
brought this piece of news, communicated to him by Bunsen,
who was in a great state of alarm and indignation, and said
that Metternich was equally alarmed and eager to do something.
The Austrian and Prussian proposals were severally
these: Metternich wished for a declaration that the annexation
of Cracow should not be used as a precedent, but
considered as an exceptional case. Bunsen suggested that a
naval demonstration should be made in the Baltic by us, of
course in conjunction with Austria and Prussia. These two
Powers now begin to see what an egregious folly they have
committed in the Cracow affair, and are filled with shame and
terror. The next morning, Friday, Palmerston saw Brunnow,
and he asked him whether this story was true. Brunnow
said he was glad he had asked him, and that he could
assure him he had never heard one word of it and did not
believe it, that he believed it to be a mere fiscal regulation
which would be advantageous to the Poles and not agreeable
to the Russians, but that the reported political move he
disbelieved. He had, however, written to Nesselrode to ask
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
what the real truth was. Palmerston, without doubt, on
this sent the article to the 'Morning Chronicle;' there is a
phrase at the end of it about Guizot quite Palmerstonian.
It is amusing to see the two papers moved by different
ministerial interests. John Russell told me at Windsor yesterday
that he believed the first account. It certainly seems
to me that it is a very bad piece of policy of the Emperor's,
if true; he has accomplished the absorption of Poland
already in fact, and what can it signify to him to do so in
form? By degrees he has stripped the Poles of almost all
national distinctions, and he has only to go on as he has been
doing for some time past to complete his work; nobody
opposed, nobody remonstrated with him at each successive
violation of those privileges which all Europe guaranteed;
and now the Powers, who patiently and tamely endured the
most flagrant violations in fact, are ready to explode with
indignation at an announcement of them in form.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUSSIAN MEASURES IN POLAND.</div>

<p>James Rothschild is come over here, partly on his own
concerns, and partly on Louis Philippe's, who is very intimate
with him and talks to him often and confidentially.
He has been with our Ministers, at least with Lord Lansdowne
and Lord Clarendon (I do not know if he has been
with any others), and said a great deal about the King's
intense desire to be well with England again, asked if we
wanted to get rid of Guizot, and intimated that if his fall
would facilitate the reconciliation he would be sacrificed
without scruple. They have no doubt whatever that he
is authorised by the King to convey this to our Government.
Clarendon told him that Palmerston would not walk
across the room to get rid of Guizot, and did not care one
farthing whether he was in or out; but that he was not
surprised that they should fancy he might desire it, knowing
as he did that they had left no stone unturned to bring about
his removal from the Foreign Office, so far as they were able
to say or to do anything to that end.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 24th.</i>&mdash;Jarnac was with me for three hours
yesterday, and I am going to him to-day to see some of his
papers. The whole of our conversation resolves itself into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
this: he said that they really had believed that the Coburg
marriage was <i>imminent</i>; that they had given ample and
repeated notice (especially in the note of February 27) that,
if ever they saw this, they should act accordingly, consider
the Eu engagement at an end, and take their own line;
that they never could get Palmerston to put on paper distinctly
that we did not and would not encourage this match.
This, involved in a vast deal of phraseology, and many
minute details, with a great deal of false reasoning, and facts
contradictory of each other, made up his whole discourse.
I endeavoured to pin him down to one or two points, from
which he was always trying to escape, and to cover his
retreat by verbiage.</p>

<p>I have made up my mind to go to Paris, Lady Normanby
having offered to take me in at the Embassy: this temptation
decides me.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 25th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday I was with Jarnac for three
hours and a half, reading papers. He showed me everything:
the copy of the famous despatch of July 19 (Palmerston
to Bulwer), which was (as they say) the <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="the source and origin of the evil">fons et origo
mali</i>; all Guizot's private letters to him, and his to Guizot;
<i>ditto</i>, between him and the king; his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="minutes">procès-verbaux</i> of conferences
with Palmerston; copy of the note of February 27
(on which they so much rely); the letter of Guizot's which
was sent to John Russell, and John's admirable answer;
Jarnac's own rejoinder; Guizot and the King on this correspondence:
in short, he gave me to read all that was
material, and that I had time to read in these three or four
hours. At all events, I believe I am now as completely in
the possession of the case on both sides as it is possible to
be, and all this information and knowledge has not changed
my opinion.</p>

<p>It is clear that we have been jockeyed by France in
a very shabby, uncandid, underhand way. Guizot's private
letters, admirably written, bear on them all the stamp of
sincerity and conviction, and are calculated to impress anybody
with the belief that he was sincere, and that he thought
he was doing what he had a right to do as regarded England,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
and what it was his duty to do as to France. But where
rights and duties are clear, there is no need of concealment;
everything may be, and ought to be, open and above board;
and besides the object of defeating a Coburg scheme and
securing the Spanish bride, there was that of preserving the
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i>, which he could not expect to do, acting as
he did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SPANISH MARRIAGES.</div>

<p>When disentangled from all its envelopments of verbiage
and mutual insinuations, the case resolves itself into one of
two very simple points, and lies in a very narrow compass:&mdash;The
new ministers came into office about July 7; it was then
about a fortnight afterwards that Jarnac spoke to Palmerston
about the Queen of Spain's marriage (not a word about
the Infanta <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="on either side">de part ou d'autre</i>). Palmerston had written to
Bulwer on the 19th, and he read this despatch to Jarnac,
and gave him a copy of it (confidentially) to send to Paris.
This was the despatch on which they ground their whole
case. It treated of two subjects: the marriage of the Queen,
and the internal government of Spain. It was very able, very
sound, but it was extremely imprudent to communicate it
to the French Government. The substance of it was this:
that we always had considered the marriage as a Spanish
question, in which no foreign power had any right to interfere.
That there were three candidates left in the field
(Trapani and young Carlos being out of the field), 'Prince
of Coburg and two sons of Don Francisco;' that we only
desired that the Queen might take whichever of them would
most conduce to her own happiness and the good of Spain.
We neither supported nor objected to any of them; that
therefore there were no instructions to be given to Bulwer,
as it was only necessary to refer to those of his predecessor,
on which he would continue to act. Then came a severe
criticism on the Spanish Government, and the overthrow of
all law and constitutional rights, still desiring Bulwer not to
interfere in any way, but not to conceal the sentiments of
the English Government thereupon. This was very strong,
very bitter, and necessarily very offensive to the Spanish
Government, and to their abettors and protectors at Paris;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
however true, and however fit to be written by Palmerston
to Bulwer, it was not wise to put it in the hands of the
French Minister.</p>

<p>After the communication of this despatch, various letters
and conversations passed with remonstrances, and not without
some vague threats. Jarnac at once objected to what was said
about the Prince of Coburg, complained it was different from
the understanding with Aberdeen, and asked if it could not
be <i>reconsidered</i>. The reply was that it was already gone.
Guizot's reply to the receipt of this despatch was confirmatory
of Jarnac's objections, and the latter made various attempts
to obtain from Palmerston something on paper to the
same effect as the verbal assurances which Palmerston gave
him. Palmerston replied (as Jarnac reported) that he could
not do this without consulting his colleagues. In the meanwhile
(I don't exactly recollect the date), Jarnac spoke to the
Duke of Bedford and Clarendon, and had an interview with
John Russell. From all of these he admits, as well as from
Palmerston himself, he received the most positive assurances
that we did not, and would not, support the pretensions of
the Prince of Coburg, and that we had no thoughts of
departing from the principle laid down by Lord Aberdeen.
It was certainly very imprudent of Palmerston to show this
despatch of the 19th, and it is clear to me that he did it for
the pleasure of provoking the French Government, and
showing them what we thought of the whole management
of Spanish affairs. It was, in fact, a covert and indirect but
a bitter attack on them. Next, he was inexcusable for not
giving them in writing that which they required, and for
allowing nearly five weeks to pass away after their urgent
demand for it, before he wrote (on August 28) the despatch,
which did not reach Madrid till long after the marriages had
been settled and proclaimed. The despatch of the 19th,
which Bulwer was not desired to communicate to the Court
of Spain, having been placed in Guizot's hands, he forthwith
sent it to Bresson, who lost no time (but without Bulwer's
knowledge) in communicating it to the Spanish Ministers,
to whom it was sure to be most offensive. Taking dates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
into consideration, it is difficult to doubt that at the same
time, or very shortly after, Bresson was ordered to settle
the marriages of both princesses, for this despatch is dated
July 19, and on August 28 the 'Gazette' at Madrid published
the Royal announcement of the Queen's marriage.
Not one word, however, was ever hinted to our Government
of any such instructions being given or being contemplated.
In one of Guizot's letters to Jarnac he gives him to understand
that, much as he is dissatisfied, he shall do nothing
fresh; and, during the whole of this interval, Jarnac continued
to press Palmerston for some positive and written
disclaimer&mdash;that is, he did when he had the opportunity,
for during a considerable part of this time Palmerston was
sailing with the Queen. There was, indeed, one letter of
Guizot's hinting at his taking a line of his own, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="an isolated policy">une
politique isolée</span>;' but this was too vague (if it were communicated,
which is not clear) to excite any serious apprehension
in anybody's mind. It is, however, clear that
well-informed persons did think it imprudent of Palmerston
not to give the French Government at once the satisfaction
they demanded, and, as I have before said, both Normanby
and William Hervey wrote over very strongly on the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BREACH OF THE ENGAGEMENT.</div>

<p>At last, early in September, the news came like a thunderclap
that both the marriages were settled and declared;
and then began the feeling of indignation and resentment
which broke up the intimacy between the two Courts, and
infused such bitterness into our diplomatic relations. The
war of notes began, and the world will judge whether
Palmerston or Guizot had the best of it. The flimsiness
of their pretext for breaking an engagement they admit to
have made is the more obvious the more it is considered;
and that it was a pretext, and one of which they wanted to
avail themselves, is evident from the care they took to make
no previous allusion to the note of February 27, which they
have since endeavoured to turn to so much account. This was
a note not delivered but read to Aberdeen, in which they said
that, if the Coburg marriage appeared to be imminent, they
should hold themselves disengaged from their pledges. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
now pretend that they forgot this note was not delivered,
and did not know that Palmerston was not cognisant of it,
but they never took any opportunity of finding out whether
he was, nor of renewing to him the menace or intimation it
contained. This omission and their secret instructions to
Bresson, while they not only kept us in the dark, but did
their best to blind us, are sufficient to convict them of
duplicity and bad faith. Palmerston, on his side, may be
blamed for imprudence and negligence. The way in which
it was taken up here, and especially the things Palmerston
said, exasperated Guizot prodigiously, and no doubt the
King still more; and it was under this irritation that he
wrote his letter (September 15) to Jarnac, containing a
bitter philippic against Palmerston, his whole character and
policy, and a comparison between him and John Russell,
much to the advantage of the latter. This letter Jarnac
was instructed to send to John Russell. He told me that he
was so well aware of its imprudence that he remonstrated
against the order, and delayed several days to obey it. His
remonstrance was disregarded, and he was desired to give
the letter to John Russell. He took it, however, to Palmerston,
told him he had a letter which he was charged to show
to John Russell, but, as it contained matter relating to him
(Palmerston), he thought it right to place it in his hands
that he might read it first and forward it to Lord John
after. Palmerston said he did not want to see it, and would
not look at it. On this he sent it to Lord John, who showed
it to Palmerston, and wrote Jarnac an admirable but very
severe answer, commenting in strong terms on the conduct
of France, and expressing his entire concurrence with Palmerston
in every particular. This reply must have been
gall and wormwood to Louis Philippe, and very disagreeable
to Guizot. Jarnac wrote an answer to Lord John, rather a
rigmarole, but defending the King. This answer seems to
have had great success at Paris, whatever it may have had
here, for there were letters from both the King and Guizot;
the first thanking his champion in very warm terms, and the
latter praising his zeal and eloquence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RUPTURE.</div>

<p>The estrangement was now complete, and resentment
openly testified. The two Courts were <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="had fallen out">brouillés</i>; the Ministers
collectively, Palmerston individually, and Normanby at Paris,
all put themselves in a cold and forbidding attitude. Our
refusal to join with France in the Cracow affair was received
as a hostile expression, and it is evident that the King and
Guizot have been getting more and more uneasy at the
estrangement, in which we persist. It is, however, not easy
to discover how far the Monarch and the Minister are acting
in real conjunction, and whether the former is faithful or
false to the latter. Guizot's conduct and the tone of his
letters do not entirely correspond; the latter evince a strong
desire to obtain a sufficient security about the Coburg alliance,
and certainly strenuous efforts were made by Jarnac
to extract some document which might have been so considered;
while, if we judge by his acts, it would seem that
all the French wanted was a pretext for concluding the
marriage, and such a written assurance as he kept demanding
would have counteracted their clever scheme of deception
and fraud. It strikes me as very possible that the
King and Guizot were not acting together; that the intrigue
was the King's, which Guizot did not dare or could not
defeat or obstruct, but that while he was obliged to work
out the King's design, he would have been really glad if
we had given such clear and formal assurances as would
have rendered the execution of the plan impossible. I did
not conceal from Jarnac my opinion that he had failed
to make his case any better; he was not a little mortified
at the admiration I expressed of John Russell's letter, in
which I in vain attempted to get him to join.</p>

<p>The next morning, just as I was setting off to Badminton,
he came to me in consequence of letters he had received from
Paris, in which he was informed that Normanby had openly
said that the two countries could never be on good terms
again till Guizot was turned out and we had obtained a renunciation
from the Duchess de Montpensier; this they
believed, and that it was the echo of sentiments entertained
here. I told him I did not believe a word of it, either that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Normanby had said it, or that anybody here wanted to turn
Guizot out; that lies of this sort were always rife on such
occasions, and I had just heard a story of Louis Philippe's
abusing our Queen at the tea-table at Neuilly, which I had
no doubt was just as false as the one he had told me, and
they might be set against one another. He then asked if
our Government were not going to lay papers before Parliament
in which Guizot would be implicated, and if so, if they
would not first give him a copy of them, and he glanced at
the printed papers to which I had referred in my conversation
with him. He said in Aberdeen's time such things
were always done in concert, and each Government previously
communicated to the other everything it meant to
publish, but of course this could not be the case now. I
told him I did not believe anything was decided about papers;
I knew of none, and what he saw in my hands was nothing
but the notes of the recent correspondence printed at the
Foreign Office by the Government press for the exclusive
use of the Cabinet, to whom it would have been too long a
process to send written copies; that such was the practice
here with regard to all important papers of any length.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Broadlands, December 30th.</i>&mdash;I came to town on Monday
from Badminton, where I went to spend Christmas. When
I got back I wrote a long letter to the Duke of Bedford
giving him an account of my communications with Jarnac
and my opinion of Palmerston's conduct of the affair. I
told him I was going to Paris, begged he would show Lord
John my letter, and said that if he (Lord John) wished me
to say anything or to take any particular tone, to let me
know. I received an answer this morning, cold enough.
Lord John only replied that as I was coming here it was
not necessary for him to see me. There was a very foolish
passage about our relations with France, 'that there could
be no reconciliation, and the spirit of Lord John's letter to
Jarnac must be maintained.' The sort of disposition they
evince, half desirous to make it up, and half to <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="sulk">bouder</i> on,
seems to me exceedingly little and unwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPOSED REVIVAL OF THE SALIC LAW.</div>

<p>Yesterday I found Clarendon at the Board of Trade, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
had a very long conversation with him; he is now all for
trying to make something of the proposal to get the Salic
Law re-established in Spain, having in the first instance
scouted it. It was first proposed to him by Baron Billing
as a solution of the difficulty; he at once rejected it as impossible.
Now he has changed his mind, and he wrote to
Palmerston and Lord John to say so, and to propose writing
to Billing to ask whether he had made this proposal with
the knowledge and assent of Guizot, and if the French
Government was prepared to assist in procuring such a
settlement at Madrid. Lord John expressed doubts, and
thought nothing would come of it but some fresh falsehood
and deceit. Palmerston thought the plan a good one, and
that it was worth while to write to Billing, which Clarendon
had done, and he showed me the letter. I think the scheme
utterly chimerical, and so I told him; in fact, it strikes me
as one of the most absurd and impracticable that ever entered
the mind of man. I stated the different objections that
occurred to me, one (not the least) being that no Spaniard
would be likely to support a measure almost sure eventually
to produce another civil war. He said that before Olozaga
left Paris he had been to William Hervey, who asked him
if he would be willing to support such a measure. He
replied that he would, and he thought all the Progressista
party would likewise; but while he now looks to this as a
possible solution of our difficulty, Clarendon is very anxious
by some means to restore a good understanding, and he
begged me to tell Guizot that if his language in the King's
Speech and in the Chambers was moderate, he would compel
a corresponding moderation here, but at the same time he
informed me that it was Palmerston's intention to supply
Thiers with information to use against Guizot; and he said
this without any expression of disapprobation. It was at
the end of our conversation, but the next day, upon reflecting
on this, I wrote him a very strong letter denouncing the
impolicy and the danger of such a communication to such
a man. I might have also urged the immorality of it, and
its inconsistency with the profession of not wanting to injure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Guizot or turn him out; the more I think of this the more
shocked I am. If it is done, and Thiers exhibits good information,
the French Government will know well enough
how he came by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON ON THE SPANISH MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>Here I have had a long conversation with Lady Palmerston,
from which I infer that Palmerston's fixed idea is to
humble France and to make her feel her humiliation, and, in
order to do so, to connect himself more closely with the
three Powers, who appear to be ready to do anything for
him if he will break with France. She abused Aberdeen,
and said he had made his agents all over the world act in
subserviency to the French; this system Palmerston considers
it his mission to put an end to, and I gather that he
means on the contrary to thwart and oppose France whenever
and wherever he can. She told me that these Powers
were now better disposed than ever to us, and regarding
France as the most encroaching Power, only wanted to join
us in keeping her down. I took an opportunity of telling
Palmerston that Bunsen and Prince Albert want to have a
pamphlet written about Cracow and German affairs, and
that the former had proposed to Reeve to write it; Reeve
said he had no objection provided Palmerston was first consulted
and approved, and this he wrote to Bunsen.<a href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
I told Palmerston that Reeve wished him to be apprised of this. He said
he was much obliged to me for giving him an opportunity of thinking of
it, but that his impression was that it would be better not to write
anything, as Cracow was now an affair settled and done, and it was not
desirable to say anything offensive to the three Powers, whose
co-operation with us was essential in the far more important concern of
the Spanish marriages. From this I infer that he means to continue to
wage war on the Montpensier marriage, and to form a sort of preparatory
league against France. I am greatly alarmed at the spirit he evinces,
and fully expect we shall sooner or later get into some scrape.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
This evening (31st) I had a long conversation with him, in
which he discussed Jarnac's communications with me (which
I had told Lady Palmerston) and with him. He declares he
gave him the verbal assurances he asked for as strongly as
possible, and he does not believe anything else he might
have done would have produced any effect in arresting the
progress of the intrigue at Madrid. The French pretend
that the Spanish Court insisted on having Montpensier, and
that the Queen only consented to marry her cousin on condition
that the King gave his son to the Infanta; that this
match was therefore a Spanish and not a French object.
He said that Villa Franca (Montemolin's man) told him that
when he was at Paris Louis Philippe said to him that he
wished the Count de Montemolin to marry the Queen; that
he had only to renounce his claims, which would be a mere
form, as he would declare himself King as soon as he was
married, and that he contemplated the restoration of the
Salic Law, which at all events he should insist on, as far as
the Infanta was concerned, whenever the Duke de Montpensier
married her. Palmerston's present idea is that this
restoration of the Salic Law may be effected, and that the
Spaniards will adopt such a course. I pointed out the difficulty
and the levity of such a proceeding: enacting a law
one day which cuts off the contingent rights of Don Carlos
and his family and lets in Ferdinand's two daughters; then
abrogating this law and restoring the former course of
succession, but preserving only one of the sisters thus let
in and excluding the other, and excluding also the heir
under the abrogated law now again to be restored, thus
re-establishing the law but not re-establishing the rights
which that law conferred. All this would make such a mass
of confusion and contradictions, and abrogating some rights
and creating others so partially, arbitrarily, and capriciously,
that the certain result would be a future state of uncertainty,
rivalry, and strife. He did not say a word to me of my
journey to Paris, nor I to him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, January 2nd, 1847.</i>&mdash;Returned from Broadlands
yesterday; I had written from thence to Clarendon, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
told him my impressions. He thinks that part of what was
said of Aberdeen is true. English agents everywhere <i>were</i>
made subservient to the French, and to such an extent that
they did not dare complain of any French misconduct,
because they knew they should be reproved and run the risk
of being humiliated in their public capacities, and he attributes
to this <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</i> of Aberdeen's much of Louis
Philippe's success in his intrigues, and the uncomfortable
state of things in Europe. He had been over to John
Russell at Chorley Wood, and found him in no state of
bitterness, but sick of foreign affairs and the plots and
intrigues he had been so troubled with, and so absorbed
with the much more important subject of Ireland that he
could take no interest in the former. In short, Clarendon
has in great measure succeeded in dissipating my alarm.
He recommends that I should advise moderation, and give
the French Government to understand that a moderate tone
there will secure one here, and he has sent me a letter for
Duchâtel, with whom he wishes me to communicate confidentially.<a href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 3rd.</i>&mdash;I saw M. de St. Aulaire and Jarnac yesterday,
and had much conversation with both. St. Aulaire said
he saw he had nothing to do but remain <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="idle">les bras croisés</i>, and
say as little as possible.</p>

<p>I go to-night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. GUIZOT'S EXPLANATION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Paris, January 6th.</i>&mdash;Arrived here yesterday morning at
half-past twelve o'clock, travelling all night from Boulogne.
I had no sooner got here than Normanby put into my hands
a box of papers, copies of his despatches to Palmerston, containing
details he was anxious I should know, and filling up
gaps in the history of the Spanish affair. The most essential
of these papers are despatches to Palmerston, giving an
account of two interviews with Guizot, and as to which there
could be no mistake, as he read to Guizot his letter, giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the details of one of them (the most important). Guizot
acknowledged its general accuracy, and made a verbal
amendment or two in it. I take for granted these papers
will be published. Normanby is very anxious they should,
and justly considers that unless they are, the strength of our
case will never be known. There are certain things contained
in them which Guizot never can explain away satisfactorily,
and which must leave a stain on his candour and
good faith. On August 28 Normanby formally proposed
to Guizot a joint action in favour of Enrique; he replied
that this would suit him perfectly, and that he would write
to Bresson and instruct him accordingly. On that very day
the announcement of the two marriages appeared in the
Spanish Gazette. Normanby of course subsequently asked
for an explanation of this extraordinary conduct. Guizot
seems to have lost his head in the excitement of his exploit,
for he replied that hearing nothing to satisfy him, and on
the strength of his note of February 27, 'J'ai agi'&mdash;that
is, that he had already acted independently and hostilely
long before the day on which he pretended that he would
give instructions to Bresson to act conjointly with us. He
endeavoured to excuse this duplicity by saying that Bresson
had acted on general, not on particular instructions; but
this was inconsistent with his 'J'ai agi.' Then about the
time of the celebration of the marriages, he had said they
would not take place at <i>the same time</i>; again, on being
pressed on this point, he said he had meant that they would
not take place <i>together</i>, and that such had not been the
intention when he said so. Jarnac told me the other day
that he had heard great stress was laid on this by us, and
that we meant to make it a matter of grave charge. I said
I did not believe it was so seriously considered, and doubted
that much more was thought about it, though at first it had
been considered as a proof of insincerity; but I find that it
is of importance, for upon the expectation thus conveyed by
Guizot rests Palmerston's defence for one of the weakest
points of his case, his long silence after hearing of the
marriages being settled. Palmerston's conduct and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
delays throughout have been quite inconceivable, and certainly
will, if not weaken his case, draw considerable censure
upon him if it all comes out. There was, in the first place,
his neglect and obstinacy in not giving in writing the
assurances he had given verbally; next, as to the proposal
of joint action, Jarnac came to him, intending to make the
proposal, but in consequence of the despatch of July 19
he did not make it. He then went to Paris, and on his
return he did make it. He could get no answer, and none
was sent till August 22. Bulwer was then instructed to
propose Enrique, and the French Government was invited to
instruct Bresson to co-operate, but he allowed a month
to elapse before he wrote this instruction; then when the
conclusion of the marriages was imparted to him, he suffered
three weeks to elapse before he took any notice, and then
sent his protest. It never would have been effectual, but
the only chance for him would have been an instantaneous
remonstrance by return of post. All these delays, such
tardiness, coupled with other slight circumstances, give some
colour to the proceedings of the French Government, and, to
a certain degree, help out their case. Normanby is fully
conscious of the damage thus done to ours, and the only
excuse for the last delay is, that Palmerston was reposing on
the assurance that the marriage of the Infanta was not to
take place at the same time with that of the Queen; but
this, when examined, will appear hardly any excuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCESS LIEVEN ON THE QUARREL.</div>

<p>I called yesterday afternoon on Madame de Lieven, who
was very glad to see me, and we forthwith broke into the
subject, without, however, any sort of agreement. She
abused Palmerston, and said if Aberdeen had been in office
it would not have happened. As to argument, she really
had none to offer, but repeated over and over that 'we had
departed from the agreement with Aberdeen;' and if not,
'pourquoi nommer le Cobourg?' She said all Europe was
against us, that we had with little dignity knocked at the
doors of the three Powers who turned their backs on us, and
that we had done good to France and harm to ourselves
by this useless appeal, as they were now more alienated from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
us and better inclined to the French, and that they all
thought us in the wrong. She said much about Normanby,
his <i>greenness</i> as ambassador, and the follies he committed;
asking advice of different people, and very incompetent
people too; and she repeated the story Jarnac had told me
of his saying we never should have harmony restored till
Guizot was turned out and the Infanta had renounced,
which, she said, had been told her by Apponyi, who had
heard it from Normanby himself. She had got other stories
of the same kind, and a heap of little charges of holding
communications with Thiers, Molé, and others hostile to the
Government. She said that the King was very angry with
our Queen for having said that he had broken his word, and
never would be reconciled to her till she had withdrawn that
accusation. I said that between his word and hers I could
not for a moment doubt, and that I suspected he would have
a long time to wait if he did so till she withdrew the charge
she had made. She said Guizot was very strong, the King
very firm, the marriage very popular, and that they all
desired nothing so much as to make known all that had
passed, secure that in so doing they should have public
opinion all the world over on their side. We parted wide as
the poles asunder, but very good friends.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 7th.</i>&mdash;Guizot appointed me at four o'clock yesterday,
but when I went there he was not returned from the
Council. I called again and saw him for a moment; but as
he said he had his courier to despatch, and '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="had to talk to me seriously">avait à me
parler sérieusement</span>,' he begged me to go to him to-day at
half-past four.</p>

<p>I called on Lord Cowley,<a href="#Footnote_3" id="FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and had a long conversation
with him. He is impatient for a reconciliation, and thinks
that far too great importance has been attached to the question
itself. He blames Palmerston severely for his despatch
of July 19, and thinks that more warning and menace were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
held out than I had conceived;<a href="#Footnote_4" id="FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> that <i>his</i> communications
ought to have satisfied Palmerston that the French Government
were in an excited state and prepared to do something
unless he prevented them. This makes his delays still more
inexcusable. He also fancies that it would never have
happened if Aberdeen had remained in office.</p>

<p>At night to the Opera, where I met Thiers and was introduced
to Molé. I am to call on Thiers to-morrow afternoon.
Molé told Normanby that he was very uneasy about two
things,&mdash;the arrest of Olozaga in Spain, and the intervention
of the Austrians in Italy, which he expected to take place.
Molé, by Normanby's account, speaks very disparagingly of
Guizot, and, by Madame de Lieven's, very contemptuously
of Normanby. It is amusing enough to hear all the stories
the people here tell and the opinions they express of one
another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCUSSION WITH M. GUIZOT.</div>

<p><i>At night.</i>&mdash;This morning I called on Madame de St.
Aulaire, whom I found, and Madame de Gontaut, whom I
did not; then, Madame de Lieven. Much talk on the old
subject, and the fire of my tongue extinguished the fire of
hers, for, without the least convincing her, I reduced her to
silence. The great gun I brought to bear on her was Aberdeen's
despatch to the Duke de Sotomayor, which proved
that Palmerston had in no way departed from the system of
conduct pursued by Aberdeen. From her I went to Guizot,
and was with him for an hour and a half. We began with
an agreement that we should be mutually frank and sincere.
He went through the whole case and exhibited all his causes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of complaint and suspicion against Palmerston, that when
he came into office he never said a word (in public or private)
expressive of a desire to be on good terms with France,
neither in his speech at Tiverton, nor in the House of Commons,
nor to Jarnac; that he never alluded to the Spanish
question nor sought to establish or confirm an understanding
thereupon with France; that the despatch he wrote to
Bulwer (19th), which contained instructions for his conduct,
was not imparted to the French Government; and that when
Jarnac spoke to him, and Palmerston showed him the despatch,
it was already gone. All this apparent reserve and
uncommunicativeness excited suspicions that he was not well
disposed and, above all, not going to tread in the footsteps
of Aberdeen. I defended him by saying that he ought to
have considered Palmerston's situation&mdash;just come into office,
encumbered with business, occupied with questions of much
more urgent importance in the House of Commons. Nothing
new having occurred about Spain, he contented himself with
desiring Bulwer to abide by his predecessor's instructions,
and really had nothing to say on the subject; that it was his
habit to write in a rather familiar, offhand style, and his
despatch to Bulwer, which was not intended to be published
or communicated, was of that description, but that it meant
nothing; and when asked, and the objection urged to the
obnoxious passage, he gave the most positive assurance that
no change of policy was contemplated. Guizot insisted that
it did not signify what he meant; that the question was,
what impression it was calculated to convey. Then he went
into the various delays, and the impossibility of getting an
answer from him; all of which served to confirm his suspicions
that a different and hostile policy was already in
active operation, that the note of February 27 gave him a
right to act, <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="should this happen">le cas échéant</i>, and that in a letter to Jarnac
(which he gave me to read) he plainly indicated his intention
by saying that if England adopted <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="an isolated policy">une politique isolée</i>,
he would adopt one also, and he asked me whether I
would not have understood what this meant&mdash;and that it
meant, what he afterwards did. I said I did not mean to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
acquit Palmerston of much negligence and tardiness; that I
thought he ought to have at once come to a satisfactory
understanding with France about the marriages; that he was
greatly to blame in all his delays, but that he did him less
than justice; that Palmerston was not the bitter enemy of
France which he supposed, and that he was reposing all
along on the faith of the engagements which Aberdeen had
communicated to him, never thought the matter pressed, nor
had the least idea that they took it so seriously; that he
must remember we did not regard Spanish affairs with the
deep interest and attach to them the same importance they
did. He said he was convinced that Palmerston came into
office with a resolution to overturn French influence all over
the world; that he fancied (as many others did) that Aberdeen
had sacrificed the interests or the dignity of England
to the French Government, while he himself had continually
been charged with doing the same thing in France: charges
which destroyed each other. But that this was Palmerston's
idea, and that he was resolved to oppose France everywhere,
to display his independence; that this was especially his
object in Spain, where he wanted to raise the Progressista
and depress the Moderado party as the most effectual means
of substituting English for French influence; that the real
reason he supported Don Enrique, and called him 'the only
fit husband,' was that he was the head of the Progressista
party, and his being chosen as the Queen's husband would
be a great encouragement and triumph to it; that this party
was the enemy of Christina and of the present government,
and for this reason our choice was obnoxious to them; that
except for these reasons he had no objection to Don Enrique,
and long ago had desired Bresson to get him recalled in a
despatch which he showed me; that he was convinced that
Palmerston not only had determined to act in the way he
had stated, but that he thought he could intimidate France.<a href="#Footnote_5" id="FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">M. GUIZOT DEFENDS THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>I replied that he was entirely mistaken: that he exaggerated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Palmerston's disposition and mistook his position;
that in Melbourne's time he did what he chose in his own
department, but that was not now the case; that all important
affairs were decided by the Government, and that John
Russell was far from having any bitter feeling against France,
and had always entertained sentiments of esteem towards
Guizot personally; that neither he nor anyone else (not even
Palmerston) wished to see him out of office. It was true
that they did think there had been on different occasions
and in various places an undue succumbing to France, but
that there was no desire to commence a general struggle
against French interests; that they would certainly see with
pleasure the Liberal party in Spain again lift up its head,
and some such reaction as should promise a Government
disposed to act in a constitutional manner, and put an end
to the despotism that now prevailed. He said that he considered
this the best and most constitutional Government that
Spain had ever had; that it was far more so than Espartero's;
that every change had been effected in a legal, constitutional
manner by the Cortes itself; while all former changes, especially
the expulsion of Queen Christina, had been effected by
violence. I said I was amazed to hear him say so, and
begged to ask him how the Cortes itself was constituted,
and whether it had not been packed by stratagem and force,
and by the most unscrupulous use of despotic power&mdash;the
municipalities having been suppressed and all free opinion
overborne. He only replied that the municipal question
was made the instrument of the Queen's deposition, and that
it had been voted by the Cortes.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to record accurately a conversation in
which we often diverged and then returned to the same
topic. I pressed him hard on his want of openness and confidence,
and urged that when the two countries had been so
long on such terms of amity, and the two Sovereigns also,
that before he proceeded to act in so serious and decisive a
manner and which could not fail to offend England, he ought
to have left nothing vague, but have said distinctly and at
once what he intended to do. He ought, if he took the note
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
of February 27 as his justification, to ascertain that Palmerston
was cognisant of that note. Why did he not as soon as
he came into office renew to Palmerston the notice he had
thought it necessary to convey to Aberdeen, and why not say
frankly that he regarded the state of the case to be such that,
acting on the right he had reserved to himself, he should
send instructions to Bresson to conclude the marriages. His
answers to this were very weak. He said that it was not
his business to look after Palmerston's affairs, and that he
had a right to conclude, since Aberdeen had communicated
with him, that he had imparted to him this note; that he
showed confidence to those who showed confidence to him,
and that he did not think Palmerston had acted towards
him in such a manner as to require such confidential communication
on his part. His real reason was (though I did
not think it necessary to charge him with it), that if he had
given notice to Palmerston, the latter would have sent off to
Madrid and probably counteracted his scheme. He insisted
that his letters to Jarnac, and the conversation he had had
with Lord Cowley (which he repeated to me word for word as
Lord Cowley had done), were warning enough and were sufficient
indication of his intentions. Besides that Bresson's
instructions were general, he had had them above a year
with a discretionary power to act upon them whenever he
had reason to believe the Coburg marriage was <i>imminent</i>,
which case he contended had arrived. I said if its imminence
arose from our despatch, Bresson had himself created
it, inasmuch as he had shown it to the Spanish Government.
He said that was not true, that Bresson had given
him his most positive assurance that though he had spoken
of it to different people he had never shown it to the Spanish
Ministers. He spoke with great energy of the King's feelings
and of his own, especially at the strong language that
had been applied to him personally, and of his having been
accused in a formal document as well as in a letter, of <i>bad
faith</i>; that it was impossible to transact business with any
confidence and in a useful manner with those who charged
him with bad faith. Such accusations were intolerable. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
then spoke of his letter to John Russell; that he had only
intended to call his attention to the difficulty of going on
with Palmerston while he put such a tone into the discussions;
that it was absurd to suppose that he had ever thought
or dreamt of effecting Palmerston's removal from office. He
excused this letter very clumsily, and said he had not expected
any answer to it (being evidently to the last degree
nettled at that which he had received). I admitted that
this letter was very imprudent, that it was very strong,
and spoke of Palmerston in terms he was likely to feel and
not easily to forgive; that he should have recollected what
a situation he placed John Russell in, who really was compelled
to answer it as he did, or to quarrel outright with
Palmerston; that if he had not answered it as he did, the
indignation and resentment of Palmerston would have been
very great, and he would probably have resigned; and that
he might have found means of conveying his sentiments in
some manner less dangerous and offensive. He insisted on
the clear intention of Palmerston, from the despatch, the
delays, and various circumstances, to depart from the engagement
with Aberdeen. I said that we could prove that Aberdeen
himself had laid down precisely the same rule of conduct
on which Palmerston had acted, and expressed the very same
sentiments; that they were recorded in a former despatch
addressed to the Duke de Sotomayor for the information of
the Spanish Government; that this was very different from
the letter to Bulwer which was neither to be shown nor any
thing done upon it, but was a reply to two important questions:
the first, whether if the Spaniards chose a husband
for the Queen not a Bourbon prince, such choice would be
displeasing to England; and secondly, if France attempted
to coerce their choice, whether England would support them.
His reply was plain and decisive: viz. that their choice would
not be objected to by England, whatever it might be; and
that while it was impossible to conceive that France ever
would attempt coercion, if she did, Spain would have the
'sympathy' of England and of all Europe. He said he had
no copy of this despatch, and did not well recollect its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
contents. I said, 'But you have seen it.' He 'had not had
it in his hands, it had been read to him.' He was evidently
much put out by the citation of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECT OF LORD PALMERSTON'S DESPATCH.</div>

<p>After a great deal more talk he spoke of his intentions.
First, however, he complained of our refusal to join with him
in the Cracow affair, and that we had done so in an offensive
manner, giving him to understand that his breach of the
Treaty of Utrecht made it improper to join with him in
enforcing that of Vienna, but that, nevertheless, he was
resolved to observe the greatest moderation and to evince
no <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="grudge">rancune</i>; that he should lay the papers he thought
necessary before the House of Peers, and make such a statement
of the whole case as he was convinced would prove to
demonstration to France, to Europe, and even to many
people in England itself, that he was clear and blameless in
the transaction; that he might deceive himself, but that
such was his sincere belief; that he should, however, do this
in language of moderation and with an earnest desire to
avoid furnishing any fresh matter for irritation; that he
should continue his endeavours to act towards England in
a friendly spirit, and he should not be deterred by her past
conduct from offering to communicate and consult with her
on all those subjects which it was desirable they should
consider with reference to their mutual or common interests.
He said he had a great deal more to say to me, hoped to see
me again, and that I would dine with him, and so we parted.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 10th.</i>&mdash;On Friday I called by appointment on
Duchâtel. There is nothing of much interest to record of
my conversation with him. He talked in the same strain as
Guizot, expressed great desire for reconciliation, confidence
in the goodness of their case, said their majority was stronger
and more secure than ever, and any change of government
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD COWLEY'S VIEW OF THE CASE.</div>

<p>Yesterday morning I went to Lord Cowley, who showed
me his letters to Palmerston giving him an account of the
state of the Spanish question and of his conversations thereupon
with the King and Guizot. These communications
ought certainly to have drawn Palmerston's attention to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
subject, and have induced him to lose no time in coming to
some understanding with the French Government. At the
same time the anxiety of the King to gain time, and his
urgent recommendations to Miraflores to have patience, may
have misled Palmerston and made him think there was no
danger. It is clear to me that what they took alarm at was
Miraflores' communication; that they really did believe the
Coburg alliance was <i>imminent</i>, and that when it was followed
up by Palmerston's despatch of the 19th their fears were
still more increased. They all along suspected both Palmerston
and Bulwer; and they did, in truth, think that between
Christina's impatience, the difficulty of finding an eligible
Bourbon, the probable intrigues of Bulwer, and the suspected
co-operation of Palmerston, unless they settled the
matter themselves <i>somehow</i> it would be settled in the way
they most dreaded. They knew, or at least they thought,
that their difficulty would be very agreeable to Palmerston,
and that it was not likely he would help them out of it. In
this state of things I have no doubt that Guizot wrote to
Bresson and told him to settle the affair if he could, and
that Bresson was furnished with fresh instructions on which
he did act, and not on the old discretionary ones on which
they now pretend that he acted. Lord Cowley thinks
Christina told Bresson that if he would at once strike a
bargain and give the Duke de Montpensier for the Infanta,
Don Francisco should have the Queen; that he instantly
accepted this proposal, sent it off to Paris by telegraph,
where it was confirmed at once. Whether this was the
exact mode or not, or whoever took the initiative, I believe
this is the way it was done; certainly the King seemed
anxious to put the question off. Lord Cowley thinks he
expected to be able to bring back Trapani. Guizot's vehemence
(for he spoke much more strongly than the King)
ought to have alarmed Palmerston. The mischief has
arisen from Palmerston being careless and thoughtless,
Guizot suspicious and alarmed.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at two o'clock I called on Thiers by
appointment, found him in a very pretty apartment full of

beautiful drawings, copies of Italian frescoes, pictures,
bronzes, books and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="notebooks">cahiers</i> of MS., the sheets (much corrected
and interlined I could see) of his work. These he
told me were his '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="only relaxation">seul délassement</span>,' and that politics never
interrupted his literary labour. We then talked about the
present state of affairs, and very amusing he was, sparing
nobody and talking with his usual abundance and openness.
He said he had read the notes that had passed between
Palmerston and Guizot; that his own opinion was that
Guizot would break down on the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="processes">procédés</i>, but that at all
events it was a quarrel <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="an all-out fight">à outrance</i>; that each accused the
other of bad faith, and could only justify himself by fixing
that imputation on his antagonist; that moderation became
impossible when such charges were bandied, and he had
read with astonishment the strong things contained in these
notes; that if Guizot had the worst of this encounter he
would fall, not however by the desertion of the majority,
not by this Chamber, but through the King. 'You must
not,' he said, 'believe what you hear of the strength of the
Government and of its security; don't believe all Madame
de Lieven tells you; <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="she is a chatterbox, a liar, and a fool; you knew her well, you were her lover, weren't you?">c'est une bavarde, une menteuse, et
une sotte; vous l'avez beaucoup connue, vous avez été son
amant, n'est-ce pas?</i>' I defended myself from the imputation,
and assured him that though she had had lovers when
first she came to England I never had had the honour of
being one of them. He then said he would tell me what
would happen: the King <span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="deceived himself">se faisait illusion</span> that the Whig
Government could not stand; but when he found out that
this was an error <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="he would be afraid">il aurait peur</i>; and if we continued to
refuse to be reconciled, he would get rid of Guizot. The
present Chamber would not overthrow him, but the King
would. '<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Do you know what the King is? The word is unrefined, but you will understand it. Well, he is a coward.">Savez-vous ce que c'est que le Roi? Le mot est
grossier, mais vous le comprendrez. Eh bien, c'est un
poltron.</i>'<a href="#Footnote_6" id="FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
I said I was surprised to hear this, for we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
thought he was <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="a good man">un homme de coeur</i>, and had given proofs
of his courage very often. '<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="No, no, I say to you that he is a coward, and when you finally discover this he will be afraid; then he will embarrass Guizot; there are forty or fifty men in the house, I know them, who will turn against him, and he will fall, not the house, nor you.No, no, I tell you that he is a coward, and when he finds himself definitely in trouble with you he will be afraid; then he will cause troubles for Guizot; there are forty or fifty men in the House that I know, who will turn against him, and he will fall, not because of the house, nor because of you.">Non, non, je vous dis qu'il est
poltron, et quand il se trouvera définitivement mal avec
vous il aura peur; alors il suscitera des embarras à Guizot;
il y a quarante ou cinquante hommes dans la Chambre, je les
connais, qui tourneront contre lui, et de cette manière il
tombera, pas par la Chambre, encore moins par vous.</i>' He
said the accusations had been so strong that each Minister
was bound to prove his own case and the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="bad faith">mauvaise foi</i> of his
adversary, and Guizot would stand or fall by the result of
the explanations. '<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="You can be sure that what I say to you is the truth, especially as it is not me who shall succeed him, it is Molé. However I speak to you openly, and I admit to you that I would be enchanted with his fall; first because I hate him, and after, because the English alliance is impossible with him; he is a traitor and a liar who behaved despicably toward me, but I shall not be a Minister.">Vous pouvez être sûr que ce que je vous
dis est la vérité, d'autant plus que ce n'est pas moi qui lui
succéderai, c'est Molé. Cependant je vous parle franchement,
et je vous avoue que je serais enchanté de sa chute;
d'abord parce que je le déteste, et après, parce que l'alliance
anglaise est impossible avec lui; c'est un traître et un
menteur qui s'est conduit indignement envers moi, mais je
ne serai pas ministre.</i>' However, he could afford to wait;
he was forty-eight years old, and his health excellent. As
long as the King was in no danger he would never send for
him; as soon as he was he would send for him. The King
could endure nobody who would not consent to be his tool;
he would never take office without being his master, <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="and I will see the end of it">et j'en
viendrai à bout</i>; he would rather continue in his independence
than take office on any other terms. He told me he
had seen the notes, and was amazed at the sharpness of their
contents. We then went out together, and walked to the
Faubourg St. Honoré, talking about his book, Napoleon, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH M. THIERS.</div>

<p><i>At night.</i>&mdash;I have been dining with Thiers, and met
Odilon Barrot, Cousin, Rémusat, Duvergier de Hauranne,
Mignet, and several others I can't remember. They were
all prodigiously civil to me, and with Cousin and Mignet
I had a great deal of conversation. Palmerston's note
arrived this morning. It is very clever and well done, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
too long, and his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="polemic">polémique</i> about the Treaty of Utrecht in
my opinion <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="uncalled-for">déplacée</i> and mischievous. But he is determined
to urge this point, and is endeavouring to get the Allied
Powers to join with him in a protest or some formal expression
of opinion upon it. I don't believe they will ever
do this; but if they did, it would probably produce most
serious consequences. His policy in this is perfectly inconceivable
to me. Normanby read it to Guizot this afternoon,
and at the same time offered him the despatch of the 19th
July (to Bulwer), and Aberdeen's to Sotomayor to publish
with the other pieces, <i>both or neither</i>, but he refused them.
I had another furious set-to with Madame de Lieven, who
is the most imprudent woman I ever saw; but we always
part friends. Normanby has shown Thiers several papers,
and Molé <i>many more</i> he tells me. I have begged him to be
cautious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEAR OF THE COBURG MARRIAGE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 12th.</i>&mdash;I called on Guizot yesterday by appointment;
found him more stiff and reserved than the first
time, and not apparently in good sorts. He did not appear
to have anything particular to say, but reverted to the
old topics; that he would not go again over the same
arguments; but it was clear that from the beginning Lord
Palmerston had a fixed policy which he had immediately
begun to carry out: to raise the Progressista party in Spain,
and destroy the Moderado and French influence with it;
that we fancied ourselves obliged to substitute English for
French influence there as an indispensable security for our
power in the Mediterranean; and we appealed to the Treaty
of Utrecht; that great changes had taken place since that
time. It was true France had acquired Algeria, and through
it a certain power in the Mediterranean; but that we had
acquired Gibraltar, Malta, and Corfu, which we had not
been possessed of before, and which were quite sufficient to
secure our power there. He said a great deal more of
Palmerston, for he still insists, and either believes, or at all
events pretends to believe, that Palmerston was bent on the
Coburg marriage, and doing his utmost to bring it about.
He really thinks it was sound policy on his part, and for that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
reason was pursuing it. I again and again assured him he
was mistaken. 'You forget,' I said, 'that when this affair
began, Palmerston had not been ten days in office, was overwhelmed
with business, and had many other things more
pressing to occupy his attention. He had found an understanding
concluded with Aberdeen, which he accepted. He
had no thoughts of doing anything; he knew of nothing
urgent that had occurred, and the truth is, <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="he did not think of it">il n'y pensait pas</i>.'
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="What!">Comment!</span>' he said, rather angrily, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="he was not thinking of it? Do you take us for fools that you would have us believe that">il n'y pensait pas? Est-ce
que vous nous prenez pour dupes que vous voulez nous faire
croire cela</span>? 'I said I believed it was so; that this Spanish
question which was of such deep interest to them was of
much less interest to us; and 'why,' I said, 'if you considered
the matter so urgent, if you knew what was going
on in Spain (which Lord Palmerston did not), and considered
the marriage you so feared to be <i>imminent</i>, why did not you
go at once to Palmerston and tell him so?' '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="It was not for me">Ce n'était pas
à moi</span>,' he replied, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="to educate Lord Palmerston">de faire l'éducation de Lord Palmerston</span>.'
'No,' I said; '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="but it was up to you to handle your own affairs">mais c'était à vous de faire vos propres affaires</span>,
and to communicate frankly with him when you wanted his
assistance.' He would not allow this. I said, since I had
been here and had seen and heard a great many things I did
not know before, I had become convinced that his alarm
about the Coburg marriage was perfectly sincere, that he
really did believe it was likely to take place, and that the
real object of the King had been to get the Spanish Court
to wait and not insist on an immediate marriage; that it was
not the despatch of July 19, but the mission of Miraflores
and what he had said to the King which had really alarmed
them. He said this was not exact; it was not that which
had given them the alarm, but from various circumstances
they were convinced that the Coburg marriage would have
been settled offhand if they had not taken decisive steps to
prevent it; that this marriage it was impossible for France
to tolerate. There was already a Coburg in England, another
in Portugal, and to have had a third at Madrid would have
been to make Spain a part of Portugal, and to have exhibited
to all the world the triumph of English over French influence;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
that this combination which we wanted to bring about, they
were bound to defeat, and then again assuming that <i>our
Court</i> was bent on it, he said: '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="The fact is that you are better courtiers than us.">Le fait est que vous êtes
meilleurs courtisans que nous.</span>' I told him that I was
assured the Court had never sought this alliance, and that
Prince Albert had long ago written to his cousin to say that
he must not think of it, as it was impossible.</p>

<p>I then asked him why Christina had been so impatient to
conclude a marriage of some sort, and why she could not
wait as the King had advised. He said, for reasons partly
personal and partly political; that Queen Christina was a
very extraordinary woman&mdash;'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="very clever, with a very impartial mind">très habile, avec un esprit très
impartial</span>'&mdash;that she had no prejudices, and he had heard
her talk of her greatest enemies, of Espartero even, without
rancour and with candour; that she had great courage, patience
and perseverance, and never quitted a purpose she had
once conceived; that royalty was irksome to her, and government
and political power she did not care about except so
far as they were instrumental to the real objects of her life,
which were to live easily, enjoy herself, and amass money
for her children, who were numerous, and whom she was
very anxious to enrich; that she was aware of the precarious
nature of her influence, and felt the necessity of connecting
herself with, and obtaining the support of, one of the great
Powers&mdash;England or France&mdash;the latter by preference, but
the former if not the latter; that she had, therefore, always
wanted the King to give her his son for the Queen, and
when he refused this, she had got angry and turned to the
Coburg alliance and the English connexion; that besides,
the young Queen was impatient to be married, and that if
they had not found her a husband, she would infallibly have
taken a lover. '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="You do not know about these princesses Spanish and Sicilians; they have the devil in them, and we always said that if we did not hurry, the heir would come before the husband.">Vous ne savez pas ce que c'est que ces
princesses Espagnoles et Siciliennes; elles ont le diable au
corps, et on a toujours dit que si nous ne nous hâtions pas,
l'héritier viendrait avant le mari.</span>' For these reasons she was
impatient to conclude, and she infallibly would have concluded
the marriage with the Prince of Coburg if we had persisted
in refusing the Duke de Montpensier, and had not effected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
some other arrangement. She trusted that the King, her
uncle, would have accepted <i>the fait accompli</i>, and at all
events that she should have been secure of English support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH PAPERS.</div>

<p>I then said that after all what was now most important
was to look to the future, that our quarrel must be fought
out, but that a short time would bring those discussions to
an end. What was to happen then? I believed and hoped
that he was not likely to be <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="overturned">renversé</i> here, and I was satisfied
Lord Palmerston would not be in England, and how
were the affairs of the two Governments to be conducted
between them? If Spain, which had once been a military
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="battlefield">champ de bataille</i>, was henceforward to be a political <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="battlefield">champ
de bataille</i> between the two countries, I did not see how any
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="agreement">entente</i> was possible. Must this last for ever? or was it impossible
that the two Governments should unite in bringing
about a better state of things in Spain, and giving to her in
reality something of the freedom and independence which
she possessed in name? He seemed by no means disposed
to enter on this subject, and as I thought I observed in his
manner some symptoms of a desire that our conversation
should terminate, I rose and took leave of him. He was very
civil, but rather formal and ceremonious on my going away.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Paris, January 13th.</i>&mdash;This morning we read in the newspapers
the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="documents submitted">pièces remises</i> by Guizot to the Chamber of Peers,
and among them, to our great surprise, an extract of
Palmerston's despatch to Bulwer of July 19, Guizot having
refused Palmerston's offer to place it (with Aberdeen's to
Sotomayor) at his disposal. Normanby immediately wrote
him a very strong note complaining of this publication after
what had passed between them. In the afternoon I saw
Madame de Lieven, who made very light of it, and treated it
as a frivolous complaint. Bacourt, who was there, endeavoured
to find excuses for Guizot, but was obliged to confess
that he had no right to use this without our permission.
When I got home I found Guizot's reply had come. He
said he had given nothing more than he had quoted in one
of his notes, and had done no more than produce the English
version of what he had quoted in French, and he asserted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
his right to do this. He finished, however, by saying that if
Normanby would send him the two despatches, he would add
them to the other documents. Normanby wrote back word
that he regretted he should have produced this extract in a
manner calculated to give a false impression of the tenor of
the despatch, sent him the documents, and hoped, as he was
going to publish more, he would produce Palmerston's last
note. There has been a schism here in the Opposition;
Billault, Dufaure, and thirty or forty deputies have separated
from Thiers, and are preparing to join Molé if Guizot
falls. It seems clear that neither party will take our side
on the marriage question, and that the Government will
not be attacked at all in the Peers, and very probably very
feebly in the Deputies.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 16th.</i>&mdash;For the last two days I have been sightseeing,
Hôtel Cluny, Churches, Notre-Dame, Saint-Germain
l'Auxerrois, the Gallery of the Louvre, and all day yesterday
was at Versailles. I had not seen it for above thirty years,
and was struck with the vast dimensions and the ugliness of
the building; it is, however, interesting on the whole.</p>

<p>I dined with Guizot on Friday; had very little talk on
politics. He came into one of the rooms where Bacourt and
I were talking and joined us. I then said that though I had
come here without any mission I had come not without the
hope of being able to take back with me something which
promised a renewal of good understanding. Guizot said he
was ready to be on good terms with us, but he could <i>do</i>
nothing of any sort or kind, and this he repeated in a very
peremptory tone. He was probably (though very civil to me)
not in the best of humours in consequence of the article
which had appeared that morning in the 'Constitutionnel'
(Thiers's paper), with a circumstantial and quite accurate
account of what has recently passed between Guizot and
Normanby about the despatches. This, which could only come
from the Embassy, has shocked I suppose everybody, and
made Guizot and his friends indignant. Normanby was himself
very much annoyed when he read the article, and at
once perceived the bad effect it would have. He said he did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
not know how it got there, but he suspects Thiers who probably
sent it or caused it to be sent; however, both William
Hervey and Craven are so hot and so unreserved that the
Opposition paper might very easily get over it. Normanby
has told Thiers and Molé everything, and Thiers came twice
in three days to the Embassy. All this is well known, and
Normanby passes for an ambassador in constant and confidential
communication with the enemies and rivals of the
Ministers. In spite of all this, within the last two days I
have found a less excited tone. We had, however, our own
complaint to make, which probably kept them more quiet
about the 'Constitutionnel.' When all the papers came out
it appeared that Guizot had published another fragment
that he had no right to do of one of Palmerston's despatches,
about 'the only fit husband.' This had been read to him,
but no copy given to him, and he took the words down with
his pencil at the time. These words he published in a formal
official shape. His excuse is the same, that the words had
been quoted in one of his notes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE TUILERIES.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 19th.</i>&mdash;Went last night to the Tuileries; the
King was very civil, but did not talk to me on any subject.
We were there only twenty minutes. I saw all the Princesses,
the Duchesse de Montpensier decidedly the best; she is a
pretty, plump little thing, and looks three or four years older
than she is. The Duchesse d'Orléans is still in mourning. The
King looks very well, and is grossly caricatured by 'Punch;'
he is a very good-looking old gentleman, and seems to have
many years of life in him still.</p>

<p>Normanby saw Guizot on Sunday about the affairs of the
Plate, when he took the opportunity to speak to him about
his second extract (from the despatch which was not communicated
to him); he made the same sort of excuse as for
the other, and reminded him that he had taken the words
down in pencil.</p>

<p>Went last night to a ball at the Duchesse de Galiera's,
where I met Francis Baring,<a href="#Footnote_7" id="FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
who told me a good deal about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
French politics. He says Thiers is quite out of the question,
and that his own errors and the schism in his party hare
demolished him. Billault and Dufaure are making a second
opposition. He thinks Guizot has more to fear from the
effects of the very grave financial embarrassment which exists,
and that if he got the country into any political difficulty
in the midst of it he might be sacrificed, but Molé is
a man without courage; the majority is the King's majority
on the whole, but still Guizot has many followers and is not
without power. It would not, therefore, be quite so simple
and easy to dismiss Guizot unless some good opportunity
presented itself. Everybody here will support the Government
in its present contest with us. He said he should not
dare to speak a contrary language to his wife, who would tear
both his eyes out if he did. He thinks we were right to
decline joint operation in the affair of Cracow, but that it is
an enormous blunder to make so much of the Treaty of
Utrecht; that it would have been wise to have made a protest,
the more vague and general the better, but reserving to
ourselves to take any course we thought fit in respect to
Spanish marriages and successions, keeping all treaties and
laws bearing on the subject in reserve, to be used or not
according to our discretion. This is what I have always
thought: the Treaty of Utrecht, the renunciations, the laws
of Spain, and the other treaties between Spain and Austria
furnish materials for a very good argument such as an astute
counsel might turn to excellent account; but Palmerston has
made the Treaty so prominent, and has been so decisive and
peremptory, that he has got into a position where he can
neither advance without danger nor recede without discredit.
I saw the other day his protest at Madrid against the
marriage in which he declared that England would <i>never</i>
acknowledge the issue of the Duchesse de Montpensier as heirs
to the crown of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUC DE BROGLIE'S SPEECH.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 21st.</i>&mdash;Was at Madame de Lieven's on Tuesday
afternoon when Guizot came in from the Chamber. He said
the Duc de Broglie had spoken for an hour and a half <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="with great success">avec un
grand succès</i>. The next morning I read this successful speech,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
which was as bad as it well could be, and calculated to
make matters worse with us. The Queen's Speech arrived
yesterday, and was thought very moderate, as it is, but very
ill written. In consequence of the passage about Cracow
none of the Ambassadors of the three Courts would appear
at the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="royal session">séance royale</i>. Yesterday Guizot spoke for two hours,
and certainly very adroitly in reference to his position
and his object; being quite sure of whatever he said being
accepted as all-sufficient by the Chamber, he could afford to
glide over the difficult points and not attempt to grapple
with them, and he carefully abstained from saying anything
irritating or offensive to us, sparing even Palmerston as
much as he could. I went to Madame de Lieven to-day,
when she asked me what I thought of the debate. I said,
'If you want my candid opinion, I will give it you. <span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="The speech of the Duke de Broglie was bad, it is unworthy of him and the reputation he has earned, and it is neither fair nor true, nor wise. If he had had the desire to escalate the matter, which I do not believe, he could not have spoken otherwise.">Le discours
du Duc de Broglie a été mauvais; il est indigne de lui
et de la réputation qu'il s'est acquise; il n'est ni juste, ni
vrai, ni sage. S'il avait eu le désir d'envenimer l'affaire,
ce que je ne crois pas, il n'aurait pas pu parler autrement.</span>'
I then said that the speech of M. Guizot was of a very
different character, that I did not attach much value to his
argument, and that he had eluded all the real difficulties of
the question, but that he had contrived to make a defence
which was quite sufficient for his purpose here (though if it
had been addressed to an English Parliament or court of
justice it might have been easily answered), and to do so
with a perfect reserve and moderation, and without allowing
one word to escape him of a violent or offensive character;
that it was very clever, very adroit, admirably adapted
to the occasion, and I thought would produce a salutary
effect <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="with us">chez nous</i>. She was much pleased, and expressed her
satisfaction that I thought this; when I said she must not
forget that I said so always with a reserve as to the argument,
and that I only meant to speak of the tone; that as
to the value of the speech in reference to the question at
issue, I agreed entirely with the 'Constitutionnel.' She
laughed at this, affected to treat it with derision, and said
that all the world knew the articles in that paper came from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the Embassy, which I treated with derision in my turn.
Guizot then came in, but only stayed a moment; she told
him that I admired his speech, but would tell him more of
what I had said when he came to her in the evening. I
then told her of the absence of the Ambassadors at the
House of Lords, which struck her prodigiously, and she
would hardly believe it. We afterwards talked of the future
and how matters could be got right, and we both agreed
that where '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="confidence had been shaken">la confiance avait été ébranlée</span>' entirely, it was
very difficult to restore it. I said the only way I knew was
to act with mutual truth and good faith, to have no <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="secrets">dessous
des cartes</i> on either side, and then by degrees each party would
discover that the other really was doing so, and by degrees
confidence might revive. But the notion of Palmerston's
hatred of Guizot is so strong, of his independent power in
the Government and his disposition to use it, that it is very
difficult to bring them into anything like a quiet and confiding
state of mind. I told her it was an error to suppose
Palmerston was so powerful and that he could drag his colleagues
with him unreasonably, and that if they found him
wantonly and unfairly endangering the peace of the two
countries, they would force him to desist or to go. Guizot's
speech seems to have been received very favourably by most
people for one reason or another, and it certainly was very
able and judicious.</p>

<p>I dined to-day with Madame Graham (a dull party), and
went afterwards to Mrs. Austin's, where I met M. de Tocqueville,
Mignet, Alfred de Vigny, M. de Circourt, Mr. Wheaton,
and several others whose names I cannot recollect. There was
also a Mr. Schwabe, who has been travelling all over Spain
with Cobden, and has a great deal to say about the country
and the people. He says there is a sprinkling of Free Trade
tendencies, but not at Barcelona. They were well received
everywhere, and by nobody better than by the French consuls
(especially Lesseps at Barcelona), whom they found advocates
of Free Trade. The country appeared miserably desolate
and depopulated, but they were told that the improvement
within the last ten or twelve years was prodigious. The

Infanta's marriage was unpopular, French influence on the
wane, and he is convinced that if the country is only left
alone, the feeling of Spanish independence will be enough
to provide an opposition to French influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DEBATE IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 24th.</i>&mdash;On Friday the newspapers brought the
English debate on the Address, which has made a great
sensation here. The speeches, especially Lord Lansdowne's,
all so moderate and expressive of an earnest desire for a reconciliation
with France. Everybody, those who hoped and
those who feared, were astonished; Guizot delighted, but
taking it coolly. We think that Lansdowne's tone was too
low, that he was too <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="obliging">empressé</i>, and that it will be misunderstood
at Paris. Then the 'Times' has been writing articles
abusing Palmerston and giving out that public opinion is
all against him, and inclines to Guizot, doing all the mischief
it can. These articles were received with a great
deal of chuckling by Guizot and his people, and the low
tone taken by Government and others corroborated their
impressions. John Russell spoke very properly, very conciliatorily,
but with more of firmness. There was a ball here
on Friday night, where I had some conversation with Molé,
Cousin, Duvergier, and Francis Baring. All are struck with
our discussion. Molé, who wishes for reconciliation and
rejoices at the spirit that has been evinced, told me he
thought Broglie's speech very bad, and Guizot's very good
and discreet, but that the latter was already triumphing.
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Have you seen">Avez-vous vu</span>,' he asked him, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="the English newspapers">les journaux anglais</span>?
<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Well, you see that we move back.">Eh
bien, vous voyez qu'on recule.</span>' Cousin said that it was impossible
for them to say anything for us in the Chamber
when we did not seem disposed to say anything for ourselves.
Duvergier said the same thing, and he with Thiers
and his people are excessively disgusted and disappointed
at the ground appearing to be taken from under their feet.
M. de Beaumont said to me last night, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="It seems that you have laid down arms.">Il paraît que vous
avez mis bas les armes.</span>' They now write from England
that it is probable there will be no discussion in either
House, a conclusion so impotent and discreditable that I
hope it will not end thus.  Palmerston can never permit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
this; both he and the Embassy and Thiers will cut a ridiculous
figure enough.</p>

<p>With great imprudence and impropriety, in my opinion,
Normanby, with Palmerston's concurrence, has been in confidential
communication with Thiers for the purpose of
enabling the latter to attack the Government in the Chamber,
it being of course expected and understood that we were to
make a strong case against Guizot at home. All the world
here knows of this connexion and blames it. Guizot is of
course indignant at it, and it renders all communication
between him and Normanby as cold and distant as possible.
Thiers is as sulky as a bear; he knows that his alliance with
the Embassy has done him no good, and now it seems
unlikely to enable him to do anybody else any harm. It is
clear to me that we are in great danger of cutting a contemptible
figure and something more, for nothing can be so
impolitic as to create a belief here that the people of England
are resolved to submit to anything rather than go to war,
and that the French Government may follow their own
devices without hindrance, for if the Minister for Foreign
Affairs (especially Palmerston) remonstrates and complains
he will probably not be supported at home. The fact is,
Palmerston's mismanagement of his case and his most unwise
persistence in his argument about the Treaty of Utrecht have
ruined him and given <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="a win">gain de cause</i> to Guizot. I must say
that I begin to think no reliance is to be placed on him, and
that he really is a very bad and dangerous Minister. It
appears that before the Session opened Lansdowne wrote to
Palmerston and desired to know what he meant to do, what
to insist on, and, in short, how they stood. He wrote
back word that he had no thoughts of insisting on any
renunciations, as it was clearly impossible to obtain them,
and that he was ready to go on with France amicably and
frankly on all matters of common interest, though of course
there could not be the same confidence as heretofore. On
this Lansdowne made his speech. But yesterday morning
in the midst of all these honeyed words there arrives a letter
from Palmerston to Normanby desiring him to go and complain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
formally of the affair of the extracts, and particularly
that what he did publish was not textually correct, and that
Guizot's <i>excuses</i> were not satisfactory. Normanby never told
me of this till the evening when he had done it. He went to
him and read the letter, and Guizot was very angry and said
<i>excuses</i> was not a proper word between gentlemen, and that
it was difficult to carry on communications when such expressions
were used. Normanby said he could only answer for the
English word in which sense he ought to have understood it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. DE TOCQUEVILLE.</div>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;I saw the despatch this morning; it was short
enough, but it would have been better not to have read it to
Guizot. This evening, however, Normanby met him at
Madame de Lieven's, when he told him he thought it not
worth while to write to Palmerston what had passed between
them yesterday, as he had misunderstood the meaning of the
<i>English</i> word. Guizot said as that was the case he had
nothing to say, and thought too it would be as well to say
nothing to Palmerston about it. So this matter is in a manner
blown over, but the same <i>animus</i> will probably generate
fresh things of the same kind.</p>

<p>This morning I called on Tocqueville and sat some time
with him and his wife, an Englishwoman. He looks as
clever as he is, and is full of vivacity, and at the same time
of simplicity, in his conversation. He gave me an account
of the state of parties in France substantially the same as
I had heard before; the schism of Billault and Dufaure, to
whose section he belongs; they could not go on any longer
with Thiers, who, he says, does not command above twenty
or thirty votes, and is out of the question. He had formerly
belonged rather to Odilon Barrot than to Thiers; said the
marriage question was most decidedly popular in France, because
considered as having given us a check which had paid off
old scores, and that the being now <i>quits</i> had rendered a future
good understanding more easy; and never did he remember
so general a disposition to be on friendly terms with us, and
to act in concert with us; he thinks the King could turn out
Guizot and make another Government, but that he is not
likely to do it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>I went last night to a ball at the Hôtel de Ville, where
amongst many fine people were all the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="middle class">bourgeoisie</i>. It was a
magnificent ball and very well worth seeing, many of the
women very good-looking and all well dressed. There must
have been two thousand people there, and the house extraordinarily
fine. From thence to a ball at Madame Pozzo di
Borgo's, the most beautiful house I ever saw, fitted up with the
greatest luxury, and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="ornate">recherché</i> and in excellent taste. There
were to be seen all the exquisitely fine people, the cream of
Parisian society, all the Faubourg St. Germain, the adherents
of the old and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rebels">frondeurs</i> of the new dynasty who keep aloof
from the Court, and live in political obedience to, but in
social defiance of, the ruling powers. They are knit together
by a sort of compact of disloyalty to the <i>de facto</i> sovereign,
and if any one of them suffers himself or herself to be
attracted to Court the offender immediately loses caste, is
treated with the utmost scorn and indignation, and if a man
very probably does not escape without some personal quarrel
and is sure to be deserted by his friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. GUIZOT AND LORD NORMANBY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning the 'Morning Chronicle'
came with a bitter and violent article against Guizot's
speech in the Chamber; the courier at the same time brought
copies of our printed papers, and I took one to Madame
de Lieven. There I found Guizot furious at this article,
which he said he was sure had been dictated by Palmerston
himself. I said I was as much shocked at it as he was, and
that Normanby regretted it very much, but that I was
persuaded Palmerston had had no hand in it, and no knowledge
of it; that he had written to Lord Lansdowne the day
after his speech saying he entirely approved of it and agreed
in all he said, and it was impossible he should have at the
same time written such a letter and sanctioned such an
article, but that I was sorry he had not taken means to prevent
such diatribes, and inspired the 'Chronicle' with a better
spirit. It was preaching to the winds. His dislike of
Palmerston is so great, and his conviction of the reciprocity
of the sentiment so rooted, that he will not allow himself to
doubt. I left them because I was engaged, and promised to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
return in the afternoon to her. When I did return I found
the perusal of the papers had made a great impression on
her. She said there were many curious things she did not
know before. I said 'Certainly, so I told you,' and I then
pointed out to her certain letters and asked her if they did
not prove to demonstration, first, that the proposal of a
Coburg came entirely from Madrid and was the desire of the
Spanish Court; secondly, that we had constantly refused
to lend ourselves to it; and thirdly, that if we had answered
the appeal to us according to the disposition they always
had imputed to us, the marriage might have been made.
She was obliged to own that it was so, but then again
returned to the old question 'Why, then, did you name him?'
I said once more for the fiftieth time that it never had
entered into the head of Palmerston or of anybody else that
<i>the mention of his name</i> would have raised such a notion or
suspicion in them or in anybody, and that it was wonderful
they would not see that if he had had the intention and that
this letter contained the expression of it, the last thing he
would have done would have been to show it to them. She
then talked again about the 'Chronicle' and the difficulty of
going on, of the unsatisfactory relations between the Foreign
Office and the Embassy, and of the great difficulty of ever
restoring them to such a condition as they ought to be in for
any useful purpose. 'How,' she asked, 'could M. Guizot
open his mind to Normanby, or talk confidentially to him,
when he knows he is intimately connected with the Opposition,
and that what he says may be repeated the next
moment to Thiers and appear in the "Constitutionnel" on
the following morning?' This is the real embarrassment,
and it is not easy to see how it is to be got over. Guizot
and Normanby are on civil terms, and that is all. When
they meet on business they discuss the particular matter in
hand, and never anything more; to William Hervey Guizot
does not speak at all; when they meet at Madame de
Lievens, Guizot appears not to see him. She says that I am
the only Englishman to whom he can talk openly, and consequently
they are very sorry for my departure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>After I left her in the morning I drove all over Paris: to
the University to see Cousin, who lives up a staircase just
like a Bencher or a Collegian. He was not at home, nor
anybody there to answer the bell, so I stuffed my card
through a crevice in the door. He is a Peer. Then to
Prince Czartoryski's, who lives in a great old house in the Isle
St. Louis, close to the Pont d'Austerlitz. The establishment
is curious and interesting. The Princess told me she wanted
a house which was spacious and cheap, and not therefore in
the fashionable and dear part of the town. They were
fortunate enough to find this, which exactly suits them. It
was the hotel of the Duc de Sully, and there was formerly a
subterraneous passage with a communication to the Arsenal.
It afterwards fell into the hands of Lambert, a great financier,
and is still called the Hôtel Lambert. Madame du Châtelet
had it, and they show the apartment which Voltaire occupied
for many years. At the Revolution it became a shop or
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="store">magasin</i>, I forget of what, but no change was made in the
building. The Czartoryskis found it all <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="dilapidated">délabré</i> and dirty,
bought it very cheap, and spent twice as much as the
purchase-money in restorations. It is a great fine house,
handsome staircase and gallery, very vast, with court and
garden, and a delightful airy prospect towards the river and
the Jardin des Plantes. The thick coat of dirt which was
cleared away had preserved the original painting and gilding,
which have come out, not indeed bright and fresh, but still
very handsome, and they have furnished it in a corresponding
style. It is not, however, for the purpose of being well
lodged that they have thus provided themselves, but to perform
a great work of beneficence and charity. The Princess
has converted the whole of the upper stories into a great
school for the daughters of distressed Polish officers and
gentlemen, where they are lodged, fed, clothed, and educated,
and what is left of their fortune they spend in this manner.
She took me all over the apartments; they are like those in
a very well-regulated pauper school, clean to an extreme
nicety, but modest and economical. The girls crowded about
her to kiss her hand. There they are prepared to become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
governesses; the Princess's daughter is their '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="English Teacher">Professeur
d'Anglais</span>,' she told me. It is a very striking sight and well
worth support. I went from thence to the Place Royale;
then to where the Bastille formerly stood, and down the
whole length of the Boulevards, which is the way to see this
curious town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FALL OF THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning news came that the
Spanish Ministry was out; a majority in the Cortes on the
question of the Presidency, composed of <span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Progressives">Progressistas</span> and
discontented <span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Moderates">Moderados</span>, turned them out. The movement
is anti-French and said to be brought about by a coalition
of the two brothers against the Queen-mother. Guizot is
evidently disconcerted by it; Madame de Lieven affects a
supreme indifference; she told me that Sotomayor was
making a Government, a <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="moderate">Moderado</i> Government, that he had
proposed to Mon to remain. Mon would not without Pidal
(his brother-in-law), and the others were willing to have
Mon, but would not have Pidal, because the two would
make the Cabinet too French. They now acknowledge that
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="without a doubt you have never wanted or done anything for Cobourg">sans contestation vous n'avez jamais voulu ni rien fait pour
le Cobourg</span>.' I asked her whether this was Guizot's opinion,
and she said '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="perfectly">parfaitement</span>.' This is incomparably cool.
After having had the most reiterated assurances <i>before the
fact</i>, which they utterly disregarded, and did not choose to
believe, now that the fact is accomplished, and it suits their
purpose to make it up, they acknowledge that they were in
error, and acted on a mistaken notion.</p>

<p>I went last night to Madame de Circourt, who has a
brilliant salon, but I knew none of the people; then to
Madame de Girardin, where were people of a totally different
description.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I prevented Normanby from going to Thiers'
salon the night before last, and yesterday morning I gave
him to understand as delicately as I could that all his communications
with him and others in opposition to the Government
were noted, reported, and much resented. He is,
however, still impressed with the notion that Guizot may
be got out, and that his connexion with his opponents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
may conduce to that object, in my opinion a dangerous
error.</p>

<p>Kisseleff gave me an account of what had passed between
him and Guizot about the despatch which he read in the
Chamber. Kisseleff said it was very irregular and improper,
but he did not think it had done any harm. Kisseleff received
it the morning of the debate in the Peers, and took it
to Guizot, telling him it might be of use to him to know the
contents. Kisseleff left it with him to read at his ease, and
begged him to return it directly, giving him no authority to
produce it. Guizot read it <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="in full">in extenso</i>. He said afterwards
that he believed it was the best thing he could do for France
and Russia too. Strange that a man so formal should be so
loose in his transaction of business.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I saw Guizot yesterday, my last day; he is very
sorry I am going, being the only Englishman he could speak
to; he does not see how he can go on with Normanby in
his notorious relations <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="with all his enemies">avec tous ses ennemis</i>; then as to the
press, the 'Morning Chronicle;' Palmerston's connexion
with it is so notorious that one might as well try and
persuade him day was night as that Palmerston was not concerned
in the 'Morning Chronicle.' I told him frankly that
I regretted both the appearance and the existence of intimacy
between the Embassy and the Opposition, that it was exaggerated,
but that I could not be surprised at its producing
an effect on him. I did not think it worth while to go again
into the case or to triumph over the effect produced by our
blue book; I only said 'that he now admitted himself that
he had been wrong about Palmerston before, and that this
might inspire him with more confidence for the future;' but
he said, 'No, he did not admit it; that Palmerston had come
into office with the resolution of attacking him anywhere;
that the Marriage question in Spain was merely subsidiary
to that object, and he had only put forward Don Enrique in
order to set up the Progressista party against him and
French influence.' He said the greatest danger proceeded
from <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="junior officials">les agents subalternes</i>; that he had given a proof of his
resolution to act justly by at once recalling the French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Consul at the Mauritius, for which he was well aware he
should be attacked here, but that it was right, and he had
therefore done it. He said he would communicate with me,
but he thinks the disposition of the other Ministers of little
consequence so long as Palmerston's are what they are. All
our conversation ran on this; his on the difficulty of going
on after all that had passed, mine on the necessity of trying.
I said what I could for Normanby, and assured him he would
find him personally easy to deal with. I then went to
Madame de Lieven, who followed in the same strain, and
said what is true enough, that Normanby, once having let
himself drop into Thiers' hands, will find it difficult to get
out again. This has always struck me. I have said what I
could to Normanby, but I came too late for that. I am
certain they are very uneasy at the effect produced both in
England (even in the midst of its apathy) and here by the
publication of our papers. Here it is unquestionably great,
although they have not yet been distributed fully. I met
Cousin last night, who was vehement on the subject, and
told me, if he had been aware of their contents, nothing
should have prevented his replying to the Duke de Broglie.
Tocqueville told me that they had produced a very great
effect; that men like himself who approved of what had
been done were inexpressibly shocked at the way in which it
had been done, and at the revelation of so much that was
false and dishonourable in the conduct of the French Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMBASSY AND THE OPPOSITION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Just setting off to London and not sorry to
leave Paris, where I am, after all, a fish out of water. I have
been most kindly and hospitably entertained, interested, and
amused, but the excitement of the particular question once
over, I feel that I have no business here, that I am not fit
for the society, and should never take root in it; the exertion
required, the stretch and the continual alacrity of attention,
would be intolerable. I have fallen in here with Scrope
Davies, a social refugee, whom I have not seen these twenty-five
years, almost the last remnant of a circle of clever men
of the world, and once the intimate friend of B.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>Yesterday I went about taking leave and went to both
the clubs: with Mrs. Austin to M. de Triqueti's studio, and
then of course to Madame de Lieven. At the clubs I learnt
the confirmation of what I had been led to believe the day
before, the extraordinary impression made here by the publication
of our blue book. It quite surprised me, not because
I do not think it very strong; but having been myself long
ago convinced and familiar with most of the details, I did
not know that people here were so little prepared for what
they had seen. There can be no doubt of the reality and
vivacity of the impression. Francis Baring told me that
men who had before told him they thought Guizot had the
advantage, now came to tell him how entirely their opinions
were changed; in short, if it be any advantage, it has done
our case infinite good and prodigiously disconcerted the
Government. I found Madame de Lieven very low and full
of resentment, especially for the publication of Normanby's
conversation with Guizot, which she said must make their
personal relations still more difficult and unpleasant. It is,
however, this document which has produced the strongest
effect of all. I told her all I had heard, and that Guizot
must make up his mind to be bitterly attacked in the
Chamber by Lamartine, Billault, and Thiers. She said that
she had no doubt of his coming triumphantly out of the
fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BITTERNESS OF M. THIERS.</div>

<p>Last night there was a party at the Embassy, at which
Thiers and Duvergier were present. Thiers had been with
Normanby in the morning. He made an attack on me for
believing all Madame de Lieven told me; said I was '<span  xml:lang="fr" title="a sponge drenched in the drivel of Mrs Lieven">une
éponge trempée dans le liquide de Madame de Lieven</span>,' and
tried his best to persuade me that Guizot was weak, his
majority not worth a rush, and that the King could and
would get rid of him whenever he found himself in any sort
of danger. 'Tell Lord Palmerston,' he said, 'when he
speaks, to say "beaucoup de bien de la France, et beaucoup
de mal de Monsieur Guizot."' I said I should give him one-half
the advice and not the other, and that Palmerston's
wisest course would be to hold moderate language, tell his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
story, and leave everybody to draw the inferences. I have
no doubt he will make a very powerful speech and present
an admirable <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> of the whole question. But this new
vigour infused into the Opposition, which will bring on an
acrimonious debate, though it may cover Guizot with mud,
will not shake him from his seat. I told Thiers he was quite
mistaken in supposing that I took my opinions from Madame
de Lieven or believed one half she told me, but nevertheless
I could not believe that the King would part with Guizot if
he could possibly help it, for he would look in vain for so
supple an instrument, and one so well able to defend him
and his measures in the Chambers. However, Thiers thinks
of nothing but mischief, of gratifying his own personal passions
and resentments. He has evidently persuaded Normanby,
and I have no doubt Normanby tries to persuade
Palmerston of the same. The cool people here meanwhile
tell me that Guizot will not be turned out, and I am inclined
to believe it. I leave the Embassy in certainly a very painful
and unbecoming condition. Normanby seems not to care
who sees his intimacy with Thiers, and he has none whatever
with Guizot. They do not and cannot converse on
anything but the merest matters of business, and their
relations get worse, and seem likely to do so; the obstacles
to an understanding sufficiently frank to be useful appear
almost insurmountable. Thiers, having got Normanby into
his clutches, will not easily let him go again, and the resentment
of Guizot will hardly be appeased, nor do I see any
chance of their ever being on really good terms. So ends
my <i>mission</i>, and it only now remains for me to give the truest
account I can of the state of affairs here to those whom it
most concerns to know it; but then it will be very difficult
for them to adopt any decisive and satisfactory course.

<p class="entry"><i>London, February 3rd, 1847.</i>&mdash;I got to town on Monday;
one hour and fifty minutes crossing the sea, which was like
a duck-pond. Saw Lord Clarendon the same night for a long
time, and Lord Lansdowne yesterday for a shorter. Told
the first all I knew and thought, and gave the latter a
succinct account of affairs in France, but did not say a word
of Normanby and Guizot. He has heard of it, however, as I
find others have likewise; and he asked Clarendon if I had
said anything to him about Normanby's goings on at Paris.
But Clarendon said he had not asked me, as living as I had

done in Normanby's house I should not like (if it were the
case) to say anything about it. I have not yet had time
to look round me and see the state of things here. It is
determined not to have any discussion on foreign affairs if
they can possibly prevent it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD STANLEY'S VIEWS OF OFFICE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 6th.</i>&mdash;I called on Graham yesterday, and sat
with him for two hours and a half, discussing <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="the rest">res omnes</i>.
He is not very well satisfied with the Government, though
wishing to keep them in rather than let in the Protectionists;
but he thinks they are inclined to curry favour with the
Protectionists, and they are disgusted (he and Peel) at the
soft sawder that is continually bandied backward and forward
between John Russell and George Bentinck, which nettles
Peel very much; and they both think, considering the
avowed sentiments of George Bentinck towards him and
his conduct, that it is very insulting to Peel. He thinks
they don't take an independent line enough, and ominously
hinted that if they meant to try to obtain the support or the
forbearance of George Bentinck and Co. they must abide by
the consequences as far as Peel and his friends were concerned.
He thinks the aspect of affairs very threatening
both abroad and at home, Stanley evidently looking to the
Government and ready to try and form one, but saying 'he
does not desire it.' After a sort of estrangement between
him and Stanley ever since their Government broke up,
they met in the House of Commons the night of George
Bentinck's Railroad motion, when Stanley very cordially
proposed they should walk home together, and then talking
over the state of affairs Stanley said, 'This can't go on.'
Graham: 'Well, perhaps not; and then it must fall on
you.' Stanley: 'I do not desire it.' The event is by no
means impossible, for this Railroad question may turn
the Government out; everything, however, indicates that
Stanley, as head of his party, is endeavouring to work his
way into office. He is all for moderation and conciliation,
and wants to allure back the mass of the Conservatives to
his standard. Goulburn they count upon; Aberdeen says
they have secured him; Gladstone they expect to get. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
it is endless to speculate on all the possible or imaginary
contingencies by which they think they can form a Government.
Stanley must now be ready to tear his hair at having
quitted the House of Commons, for with all his great power
of speaking (never greater than now) he is lost in the House
of Lords where it is all beating the air. Then in the House
of Commons he must trust to George Bentinck and Disraeli:
the former with an intemperance and indiscretion ever
pregnant with dangerous dilemmas; and the other with a capacity
so great that he cannot be cast aside, and a character
so disreputable that he cannot be trusted. The Duke of
Wellington would give Stanley every support, and would
bring Dalhousie with him if Dalhousie was not afraid of
embarking in such a concern and with such associates.
What Stanley and his party would like best would be to
get Palmerston to join them and be leader in the House of
Commons, which Palmerston would himself delight in if he
dared run the risk. At this moment, however, everything
is in a fearful state of uncertainty, and the weakness of the
Government and their total want of power are lamentably
apparent.</p>

<p>Aberdeen is in a state of violent indignation at the brutal
and stupid attacks on him in the 'Morning Chronicle,'
which he attributes to Palmerston; and he is so provoked
that he says he is disposed to bring on a foreign discussion
after all, that he may vindicate himself. He says that
nothing could exceed the abhorrence in which Palmerston
was held all over Europe, at the small courts more than at
the great ones, from Washington to Lisbon but one sentiment.
I sat next to Palmerston at the Sheriffs' dinner, and
told him a great deal about Paris, and especially the mischief
which the 'Morning Chronicle' had done there. He said,
'I dare say they attribute the articles to me.' I told him
(since he asked me) that they did, and that it was difficult
to convince them that they did not emanate from him. He
affected to know nothing about them, but I told him it
really would be well to find means to put a stop to them.
Meanwhile, the attacks on Aberdeen have drawn down on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Palmerston two vigorous articles in the 'Times,' which may
teach him that he has everything to lose and nothing to
gain by such a contest; the very inferior articles in the
'Chronicle' not being read by a fifth part of those who read
the far better ones in the 'Times.' I met Beauvale<a href="#Footnote_8" id="FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
last night at Palmerston's, and found he took precisely the same
view of foreign affairs (especially of the Spanish question of
succession and renunciations) that I do, and it is pretty
evident that he has as little respect as anybody for his
brother-in-law's foreign policy. He said he could do no
good, and therefore held his tongue, but that he had written
to John Russell in the beginning, and told him he did not
think the case on the Treaty of Utrecht could be maintained.
Lady Palmerston had told me that Beauvale had examined
the matter, <i>and entirely concurred in their view of it</i>!</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOSTILITIES IN THE PRESS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 8th.</i>&mdash;With Aberdeen yesterday for a long time.
He complained much of the articles in the 'Chronicle'
against him, and said he had acted towards Palmerston
throughout in the most amicable manner. He still is
reluctant to believe Guizot so false as our case against him
tends to prove, and thinks that he was sincere in his distrust
of Palmerston and in his conviction that the Coburg marriage
was <i>imminent</i>; and he cannot believe he was so <i>stupid</i> as to
say what Normanby represents about <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="at the same time">en même temps</i>, &amp;c.
Nevertheless, he blames much that Guizot has done, thinks
his letter to John Russell the height of indiscretion, and
has not a word to say for the secret despatch to Bresson of
December 10, which he never saw and which never was
communicated to him. He said it was written just when
the Government appeared about to break up and Palmerston
to be coming in; but he acknowledged that as long as he
remained in he was left in complete ignorance of it. He
said he was the more surprised at Palmerston's delays
because he had told him (and John Russell too) that the
French Government were positively insane on the Marriage
question; that great as their confidence was in him, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
were in a state of continual suspicion and alarm, and always
<i>at</i> him about it; that the memorandum of February 27 was
no more than they had repeated verbally fifty times, and he
had told Palmerston that they always said they should hold
themselves free from their engagement if they saw this
danger, but that he (Aberdeen) had constantly told them
nothing was doing or intended, and that they need not
alarm themselves. I asked him what necessity there was
for this memorandum at that particular time? He said that
about that time Prince Leopold did go to Lisbon, and they
fancied he was going to Madrid, and the danger therefore
increasing.</p>

<p>Aberdeen declared that Peel would never take office; it
had been suggested to him that the country was in such
a state that he might be called for by a great public cry.
Peel replied, 'Let them call, but I will not respond.' There
is great doubt and uncertainty about the Railroad measure
of Thursday next. John Russell is thought to have acted
very weakly not to have made up his mind till so late. He
sent word to George Bentinck in the middle of his speech
that he meant to let him bring in his bill. Now it is
suspected he means to give way in whole or in part; if he
does, I think it will be fatal to his Government. Lincoln
said last night that it would be handing it over to the
Protectionists, nothing else.</p>

<p>I dined with M. de St. Aulaire last night, who talked
much of Guizot and Normanby, and of Guizot's <i>heroism</i> in
foregoing the temptation to speak in the Chamber (as if he
had meant to forego it), and to vindicate himself from the
aspersions thrown on him by Normanby's despatch, which he
was aware had done him the greatest injury here. However,
he will not have done himself much good by his speech,
which seems only to make bad worse. The result, too, of
all the intimacy between Thiers and Normanby, by Palmerston's
desire, is amusing when Thiers does not make half a
case against Guizot, and announces to the Chamber that
Palmerston is odious to all Europe and hateful to the three
Northern Courts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 15th.</i>&mdash;Called on Friday morning at Apsley
House and had a long talk with Arbuthnot. The Duke
came into the room, stayed a very little while, but excited
himself talking about Spain and the Treaty of Utrecht, the
pother about which he declared was 'all damned stuff.'
Arbuthnot told me he was most anxious for the prosperity
of this Government. Arbuthnot did not confirm what
Graham said about the Duke's leaning to Stanley; on the
contrary, he talked of Stanley's being lost amongst such
associates as he has; he talked with bitterness of Peel's
conduct and the breaking up of the party, and said he was
quite sure he would never come into office again; he gave
me a more detailed account of his parting request to the
Queen, when he said, after begging her never to ask him to
take office again, that he could not help remembering that
Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Canning had all died in office,
and victims of office; that he did not dread death, and this
recollection would not deter him; but when he recollected
also that Lord Castlereagh and Lord Liverpool had also
died in office, the one a maniac and the other an idiot, that
recollection did appal him, and he trembled at the idea of
encountering such a fate as theirs.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning John Russell sent for me, and I told
him all about Paris and the state of affairs there. I did not
conceal from him my opinion of Palmerston's conduct,
though I had done all I could to defend him. He said in
many respects Guizot's was as bad, especially as to the
newspapers. I found fault with the negotiations with other
Powers to join with us in a demonstration about the Treaty of
Utrecht, but that he defended. I told him we totally differed
on the question; but we had no time to discuss it, indeed,
little to discuss anything, for he was going to a deputation,
so we walked together from his house to the office. I told
him I had intended to urge him to do something, but that
Guizot's speech made it almost impossible to do anything.
He begged me to see St. Aulaire and talk to him about it,
and to tell him the Queen had a great regard for him, and
did not mean to do anything neglectful by him. He gave me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
an account of the strange state of things at Madrid, and of the
confusion and quarrels which have followed this fine marriage
the French have effected.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 16th.</i>&mdash;I saw Jarnac yesterday and had a long
conversation with him. He defends Guizot, of course, but a
great deal that he says is reasonable enough. Normanby
took up Guizot's speech with a very unnecessary display of
resentment, and fancied that he intended to impeach his
veracity in respect to his second report of conversation.
Accordingly he wrote an angry letter home, to which Palmerston
immediately wrote an answer. Both these letters
(<i>Normanby's altered here</i>) were laid before Parliament, and
at the same moment published in the 'Morning Chronicle.'
This was quick work, and on the whole irritating and
offensive, but Normanby says all Paris considered that he
was affronted by Guizot, and he was obliged to take it up.
Here no one individual that I have seen construed what
Guizot said in that sense. Such is the difference of the
respective atmospheres of the two towns. There all fire,
here all ice. It seems that Normanby made no communication
on the subject to Guizot, but that the latter became
aware of the resentment he had caused and made some sort
of indirect offer to say something in the newspapers. This
Normanby would not hear of, and said the reparation must
be made in the tribune where the affront was given. There
the matter stands. Jarnac thinks the appearance of the
two last letters will rouse great indignation at Paris and
complicate matters still more. He denies that there was any
intention on the part of Guizot to impeach Normanby's
veracity, and that his very vague and guarded intimation
that the report was not accurate by no means implies such
a charge. I think it very questionable whether any report
of a <i>conversation</i> ought to be published without the party
being referred to, and having an opportunity of admitting
or denying the accuracy of such a report. It is a very
nice matter, especially when the conversation passes in one
language and the report is made in another. But Jarnac
complains (and not without reason) of the tone of Palmerston's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
letter. He says he was quite right to support his
Ambassador, but he has done so in terms unnecessarily
offensive to Guizot, and when he says that he has no doubt,
notwithstanding what passed in the Chambers, of the perfect
accuracy of the report, he transgresses the bounds of
courtesy, and speaks positively to that of which he cannot
by possibility have any knowledge. This criticism appears
well founded. He said that similar circumstances had
occurred here about reports of conversations, and that Palmerston
himself had denied the accuracy of a report he had
made of a conversation, and that his denial was admitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GEORGE BENTINCK'S RAILWAY SCHEME.</div>

<p>Jarnac says if Guizot had been informed by Normanby
or by any common friend that what he had said was
offensive to Normanby, he is sure he would have given a
sufficient explanation, but unluckily none of the Embassy
are on such terms with him as admit of an amicable remonstrance.
I told him what had passed between John Russell
and myself, and that he wished me to see St. Aulaire. We
agreed, however, that it was no use saying anything more
till we saw how this matter proceeded at Paris. Matters
are now as bad as possible there, and the French Embassy
here think that the King alone can make them up. He is,
however, exasperated, it seems, for Howden attempted to talk
to him the other night, when he got excited and flew out,
especially about the attempts to assail Guizot. Of course
this squabble renders his position only the more secure, for
his removal now on any pretext would be a dastardly concession
to England which nobody in France would endure.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 19th.</i>&mdash;George Bentinck's railway scheme was
signally defeated on Tuesday night: he had 118 with him,
many less than he expected. He made a great exposure of
himself in a reply full of bad taste, bad judgement, and
impertinence. Peel made a very able speech, his attempts
to reply to which were pitiable; the minority consisted of
sad rubbish. Yesterday morning I was with Lord Lansdowne,
and took the opportunity of pouring a broadside
into him about the management of foreign affairs, and the
necessity of his taking some decisive steps to prevent that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
everlasting <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="little war">petite guerre</i> that Palmerston will wage. I spoke
very strongly indeed, and told him what the real state of
affairs was at Paris. He made great grimaces and seemed
vastly struck with what I said, and I hope something may
come of it. This morning I have a letter from Normanby
bitterly complaining of the article in the 'Times,' in which
he is accused of holding communication with the enemies of
the Government, and says it came at a very critical moment
and prevented Guizot making the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="amends">amende</i> he otherwise would
have done.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 20th.</i>&mdash;Matters get blacker and blacker at Paris,
and Normanby has got himself into a deplorable fix from
which at present there seems to be no exit. I have letter upon
letter on the subject, all full of grief and confusion. Normanby
himself writes to complain of the harm the 'Times'
has done him (a second letter), but seems still unconscious
that it is his own precipitancy and Palmerston's violence
that have got him into the scrape. The agitation at Paris is
extreme, and the whole Embassy now seem frightened and
to be recovering (now that it is too late) from their hallucinations
about getting rid of Guizot, and their being able to
carry everything with a high hand. William Hervey even
now writes something like sense; and Howden tells Clarendon
the truth, and just what I have been saying all along.
Craven writes to me and anticipates nothing but Normanby's
return and eventually war.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 22nd.</i>&mdash;On Friday Lord Lansdowne called me
into his room, and told me I should be glad to hear that
there was a probability of the quarrel at Paris being settled,
as the King had undertaken to mediate between the parties.
I went up to St. Aulaire directly after, but he had heard
nothing of it. He expressed joy, and said it had all along
been the only solution he had looked to. He then showed
me a letter from Guizot to him, written two days after the
debate, in which he said that he had spoken of Normanby
with the greatest reserve, and avoided saying anything which
could impugn his veracity or the intentional incorrectness
of his report. I asked him whether Guizot would have said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
this to Normanby if he had applied to him, and he said certainly
he would, he had no doubt of it. He then told me that
a fresh ingredient had been cast into the cauldron from the
foolish incident of the invitation to Guizot, and he read me
a letter from M. de Cazes with an account of it. Normanby
gave a great assembly on the 19th, and amongst the invitations,
one was sent <i>by mistake</i> to Guizot. Nothing ought to
have been done but to let it alone; but very foolishly they
made a great noise about it, and in a manner which was considered
personally insulting to Guizot; they proclaimed all
over Paris that they never intended to invite him. It had
been settled in the first instance that the Ministers and
others belonging to the Government should go to this party,
and Guizot wished them to go; but after this incident M. de
Cazes said it was thought impossible to go, and he believed
none would. So much for <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="awkwardness">gaucherie</i> and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="clumsiness">maladresse</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF THE PROTECTIONISTS.</div>

<p>On Friday there was a fight and a division, in which the
Government beat Stanley by eight. He probably did not
make great exertions, but, on the other hand, not one of the
Peelite peers, members of the late Government, voted with
this. The whole affair was characteristic of Stanley, and, as
such, is worth recording. He had resolved to attack the
Sugar measure of the Government by proposing to refer it to
a committee, and he sent for his peers to come up and support
him. Clarendon asked him if he really intended to do this,
and suggested he had better inform himself of the merits of
the question before he decided. He agreed, and they sent
Wood, the Chairman of the Excise, to him, who was with him
for two hours, explained everything, and satisfied him the
measure was unobjectionable. After this Clarendon asked
him again if he still meant to bring on his motion. 'Oh yes,'
he said, 'I mean to give you a gallop. It is a long time since
you have had one, and it will do you good. Besides, I have
brought my people up, and I must give them something to
do now they are come.' If he had got a majority he would
have been more perplexed than the Government, and this is
the man the peers are ready to follow and to make Prime
Minister. The Railway debate and the speech of George
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Bentinck have thrown the Protectionists into consternation
and dismay. Any remaining illusion about him has been
entirely dissipated by the display of his intemperance and
incapacity, but they have got him mounted on their backs,
and they don't know how to shake him off. It is pretty
clear too that there is no cordiality between him and
Stanley, and that the Carlton dinner scene is still rankling
in the mind of George Bentinck, as was sure to be the case,
for he never forgets or forgives anything or anybody. He
held forth the other night to Charles Villiers against Stanley's
folly for bringing forward this sugar affair; said he had no
case, and that he was 'a pretty fellow to find fault with him
for proposing the advance of public money he had done: he
who had proposed first a loan of twelve, and then a gift of
twenty millions to the West Indians.'</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 23rd.</i>&mdash;The Normanby quarrel is not made up:
very far from it. The King had an interview with Normanby,
but does not seem to have attempted a reconciliation. Lord
Lansdowne, it seems, fancied he was going to do so from
something which Howden had written. I had a long letter
yesterday from Normanby full of futilities and excitement,
and still fancying that Guizot is weak. Normanby's assembly
on Friday was attended by none of the Government or Court
people, and Guizot's (for it was one of his nights) was crammed
full. The <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="diplomatic corps">corps diplomatique</i> went to both. Nothing can be
more deplorable than the state of the affair, and Normanby
seems quite unconscious of the poor figure he is cutting.
Jonathan Peel came to me yesterday fresh from Paris, and
says the spirit rising there and the excitement are very
great, and matters have got into such a state, that the least
collision anywhere, or any difference however slight, would
produce an explosion and most likely a war. He says the
people most against Guizot are now still more against England.
One man (he would not tell me his name) said to him,
'M. Guizot has rode his race in a manner that gives us great
satisfaction, but there seems to have been a little crossing and
jostling in it.' The King <i>insinuated</i> to Normanby the other
day that he did not approve of Guizot's conduct, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
though he must support him <i>now</i>, he might get rid of him
by and by&mdash;at least it appears Normanby put this construction
on what he said, and continues in the miserable
delusion that Guizot will fall. This cauldron is now boiling
furiously: the bitterest resentment, immense excitement,
continual mischief-making, passion, incapacity, falsehood,
treachery, all mingling in the mass, and making a toil and
trouble which everybody looks at with dismay and disgust,
except probably Palmerston himself. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer introduced his Budget last night with the loan,
and was very well received. I was sure it would take.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTEMPT AT RECONCILIATION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 24th.</i>&mdash;Went to John Russell yesterday morning
to talk to him about French affairs; found him just
going to Cambridge House, so walked there with him. I
told him all I thought and all I heard from Paris. He said
it was all very bad, but that Guizot's conduct had been
atrocious. He let it be said all over Paris that he had given
the lie to Normanby and never made any explanation. I
said I was not inclined to defend Guizot, but that he was not
just in this respect. We had not much time to talk it over,
and he ended at the gate by saying, 'Well, I think they have
both behaved as ill as possible.' 'There,' I answered, 'I
entirely agree with you: but what is to be done?' He said
he would do what he could, but he knew not what could be
done. I suggested that Normanby had better come away for
a time to get a break or a pause. He said Normanby wished
this, but they were against it, and so we parted. I see that
it will be very difficult to whip him up to any sustained
exertion, and everything will probably go on <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="from day to day">au jour la
journée</i>.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 25th.</i>&mdash;I did not think anything could surprise
me about Palmerston or his colleagues&mdash;the audacity of the
one or the endurance of the other; but I was surprised yesterday.
In the morning I went to the Euston Station to
meet the Duke of Bedford and bring him to Belgrave Square.
I then told him the state of affairs at Paris, what I had said
to Lord John and Lord Lansdowne, and entreated him to try
and do something and get something done. On Saturday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
last there was as usual a dinner at Palmerston's, where
John Russell dined. At night, Clarendon had some talk with
Beauvale who asked him how long this state of things was
to go on, and if he was not aware of the danger of it; that
it was no use to speak to Palmerston, but he thought <i>he</i>
(Clarendon) might do something, and that he had been just
talking to St. Aulaire on the subject. There they parted;
but on Sunday morning he received a note from Beauvale
saying that he found matters were much more serious than
he had been aware of, and by a communication he had
had from St. Aulaire that morning he learnt that Palmerston
had formally announced to him that <i>unless Normanby
received an immediate and satisfactory reparation the intercourse
between the two countries should cease</i>. This was done
by Palmerston without any concert with, and without the
knowledge of, his colleagues; and though John Russell,
<i>the Prime Minister</i>, dined with him the same day, he did
not think proper to impart to him what he had done.
Clarendon then resolved to act without loss of time, but he
first went to call on Charles Wood, where he found John
Russell. He opened on the subject of the state of the
French quarrel and its possible consequences, and said,
'What should you say if Palmerston was to make a communication
to St. Aulaire that unless reparation was offered
to Normanby, all intercourse between France and England
should cease?' 'Oh no,' said John, 'he won't do that. I
don't think there is any danger of such a thing.' 'But he
has done it,' said Clarendon; 'the communication has been
made, and the only question is whether St. Aulaire has or
has not forwarded it to the French Government.' This at
once roused Lord John, and he instantly wrote to St. Aulaire
requesting him, if he had not sent this communication to his
Government, to suspend doing so. Fortunately it was not
gone. What passed between Lord John and Palmerston I
do not know, but the result has been a more moderate
instruction to Normanby from both of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON THREATENS A RUPTURE.</div>

<p>Lady Palmerston had a letter from Madame de Lieven
last night, expressing her hopes that it would be arranged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
which looks as if Guizot would not reject the overture. She
told me in the morning that St. Aulaire had asked Palmerston
to get Normanby away, and whether they could not <i>send him
out to India</i>!!! All this supplies very serious matter for reflexion.
It exhibits in the first place in the most striking
manner the character and the determination of Palmerston,
and I have not the least idea that the check he has received
will either discourage or deter him for the future. He will
soon begin again on this or some other matter. It exhibits
likewise the tameness of his colleagues, who will submit to
this and anything else he may choose to do. Most of his
colleagues, indeed, will never be aware of what has occurred.
Lord John, Charles Wood, Clarendon, and probably Lord
Lansdowne know it; but most likely the others will remain
in ignorance. Lansdowne may tell Auckland. It strikes me
that there is something base and false in the transaction.
Palmerston, in a manner which ought not to be forgiven,
takes this important and violent step by his own authority,
and without the knowledge of any of his colleagues.
He is found out, baffled, and he ought to be mortified, and
to think himself to a certain degree dishonoured. To have
a communication of his<a href="#Footnote_9" id="FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
countermanded, without his knowledge,
by the Prime Minister, is a sort of affront which
any high-spirited man would naturally resent; but he is
too much in the wrong to resent it; so he submits. An
honourable, straightforward man would not have acted as
he did; a high-spirited one would not have endured such a
rebuff and mortification. But a Prime Minister who was
sensible of the right and the duty of his position would not
endure such conduct as Palmerston's, would not be satisfied
with interfering in this particular case, but would at once
assert his authority, loftily, firmly, and with a determination
that it should be permanently respected. This I am pretty
sure Lord John has not done.<a href="#Footnote_10" id="FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
How he has settled the affair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
with Palmerston I know not, but it is certain that he has
done no more than stop this attempt, and has left everything
to go on as it may. The consequence is a state of
things at once dangerous and disgraceful: he dissatisfied
with Palmerston and entirely distrusting him; Palmerston
dissatisfied and angry with him; the rest of the Cabinet
either ignorant of what is going on, or disinclined and afraid
to interfere. I have not the least idea of Palmerston's changing
his conduct or his policy. His fixed idea is to humble
France, and to wage a diplomatic war with her on the Spanish
marriages, and to this object to sacrifice every other. He is
moving heaven and earth to conciliate the Northern Courts.
Ponsonby is doing everything he can at Vienna, and holding
the most <i>despotic</i> language. While there is the finest field
open for us in Italy, and a noble part to be played, Palmerston
is ready to truckle to Austria, and to abandon or counteract
the Pope.<a href="#Footnote_11" id="FNanchor_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>I met Sir Robert Peel yesterday and walked with him
some time. I have not had so much conversation with him
for years. He praised the Budget, lamented the state of
foreign affairs, and talked of Palmerston as everybody else
does. I said we were always in danger from him, and he
must know how difficult it was to control him. He said, 'I
am only afraid that Lord John does not exert all the authority
and determination which, as Prime Minister, he ought
to do'. I said, he did it <i>by flashes</i>, but not constantly and
efficiently.</p>

<p>Yesterday young Mr. Walter was brought to the office
and introduced to me. Old Walter is dying, and his son is
about to succeed (in fact has succeeded) to the throne of the
'Times,' and to all the authority, influence, and power which
the man who wields that sceptre can exercise. He seems
mild, sensible, and gentlemanlike. Though it was the first
time we ever met, he talked to me with great openness about
the affairs of the paper and the people connected with it. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
was surprised to hear from him that my original friend
Barnes, who left behind him a great reputation, was (though
a good scholar) an idle boy, who never wrote a line in the
paper, and never had anything to do with any one of the
articles which all the world attributed to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL THREATENED.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 28th.</i>&mdash;At Court yesterday to make Lord Grey
Lord-Lieutenant of Northumberland. They were in high
spirits at the Prince's election at Cambridge.<a href="#Footnote_12" id="FNanchor_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Lord John
Russell told me that the work of reconciliation at Paris was
going on favourably. He asked St. Aulaire to give him a
copy of what Guizot had written to him about his speech
as to Normanby, which he did, and then asked him to write
it officially to Palmerston. St. Aulaire said he could not do
this without Guizot's consent, but he would ask him, and
had no doubt he would give it. St. Aulaire read me a letter
from Guizot, in which he said that he had no desire to get rid
of Normanby, and begged me to write to Normanby and tell
him so, which I did. Palmerston was at the Council yesterday
with his usual gay and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="casual">dégagé</i> air. The day before <i>for
the first time</i> the matter was mentioned in the Cabinet, but
in Palmerston's most offhand and dashing style. I found,
however, that Grey was acquainted with what had passed,
for he spoke to me about it. I did what I could to inspire
him with a security I do not myself feel. There have been
reports abroad of a dissension in the Cabinet about the Irish
Poor Law, but it is not true. They have been all agreed,
and in fact there has been no disagreement on any subject
hitherto.</p>

<p>I always forget to notice a thing I heard many months
ago, but which has never been known or talked of. A man
(whose name and history I have now forgotten), who thought
he had some claims on the Government for remuneration or
employment, made several applications to John Russell, who
would not attend to them. The fellow turned savage, and
was heard to utter threats of personal violence, which from
his determined character gave great alarm to the friends and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
adherents who heard of them. Great uneasiness prevailed
for a time, and many consultations were held, and the matter
was deemed so serious, that at last they resolved to get the
man out of the country, and to purchase his forbearance,
though not with public money. In this emergency the Duke
of Bedford came forward and agreed to pay him a pension of
300<i>l.</i> a year, with which he was satisfied, and went abroad.
The Duke, intimate as I am with him, never mentioned the
matter to me in any way, and he does not know I am aware
of it. I think it was Le Marchant who settled this affair,
and I do not believe Lord John himself has ever been informed
of it.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;Accounts came yesterday that this miserable
quarrel of Normanby's was made up, but the end
answered to the beginning, and nothing could be more
pitiful than the reconciliation. Howden wrote Clarendon
an account of it, in which he said very truly that Normanby
was like the month of March&mdash;coming in like a lion, and
going out like a lamb. He got the worst terms he possibly
could, very different from his first pretensions. Apponyi
managed it, and they met at his house. Guizot gave Apponyi
a verbal assurance that he never intended to impugn Normanby's
veracity, and he received one that Normanby had
not intended any incivility in the matter of the card, nothing
more, and this after Normanby had proclaimed that he
would accept nothing but an apology in the Tribune of the
Chamber of Deputies, and Palmerston had informed St.
Aulaire that if such an apology was not made, the diplomatic
relations should cease, and that it was for Guizot to
consider whether he should establish between England and
France the same state of things as existed between France and
Russia&mdash;the business of the two Governments being transacted
by Chargés d'Affaires. A most lame and impotent
conclusion indeed. Normanby feels this acutely, for he
writes to me a querulous letter, in which he says that, 'if he
had obtained less than he had a right to expect, and if his
position <i>there</i> should not be quite as good as if he had insisted
on more, it would be owing to the cavils and criticisms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
of those over-candid friends who allowed their opinions of
the probability that there must have been some <i>indiscretion</i>
on his part to be known through Jarnac or some one of that
description exactly in the quarter where it was calculated to
do the most mischief.' It is really a comical instance of
self-delusion, to see Normanby going on even to me, protesting
his innocence of the charge of indiscretion and of communication
with the French Opposition, <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="especially">notamment</i> Thiers.
It really is incredible that he can so deceive himself, and
fancy he can deceive others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHY OF CORNWALL.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;At the Stud House on Thursday and Friday.
There I read one evening a part of one of my journal books,
and I am glad I made the experiment, because I discovered
how trivial, poor, and uninteresting the greater part of it
is. I had read it over myself the night before, and did
not find this out; but when I came to read it aloud, I saw
at once that such was the case, with a few things worth
hearing scattered about it, but on the whole dull. This has
satisfied me that a very careful revision of the whole is
necessary, and a selection of such parts as may hereafter be
deemed readable.</p>

<p>George Anson told me yesterday that the Queen's affairs
are in such good order and so well managed, that she will be
able to provide for the whole expense of Osborne out of her
income without difficulty, and that by the time it is furnished
it will have cost 200,000<i>l.</i> He said, also, that the Prince of
Wales when he came of age would not have less than 70,000<i>l.</i>
a year from the Duchy of Cornwall. They have already
saved 100,000<i>l.</i> The Queen takes for his maintenance whatever
she pleases, and the rest, after paying charges, is
invested in the funds or in land, and accumulates for him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 13th.</i>&mdash;On Thursday night 'Cracow'<a href="#Footnote_13" id="FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> came on
again, when George Bentinck made a long, violent, foolish
speech, running counter to everybody's sentiments, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
extravagantly praising the three Great Powers who had perpetrated
the deed. Peel followed in a speech full of sense
and judgement, and very good for the Government, the
whole of whose conduct in this matter he warmly supported.
Nothing can exceed the disgust and despair of the Protectionists
at the extravagance and folly of their leader, but
they have got him, and cannot get rid of him; they are in
a regular fix, and every day becoming more disorganised
and discontented. Meanwhile he, by all accounts, improves
in manner and facility, which only makes him the more
dangerous because he is full of increased confidence in
himself, and pours forth with the utmost volubility the
nonsense with which his head is full. I met Lyndhurst
at dinner the other day, whom I have not seen for a long
time, and he began talking in his usual offhand style: said
that George Bentinck had ruined the party, and, if it was
not for him and for Peel, that the Conservatives would
all come together again. If this Government would now
avoid all extremes, he thought they were in for a long time.
He had told Stanley that, unless they could make some
great exertion before the next election, the party was at
an end. Stanley said 'they should do very well.' I asked
Lyndhurst what could be expected of any party of which
Stanley was the head, to say nothing of George Bentinck,
and he owned he was utterly unfit; still, Lyndhurst has
a hankering after patching up the party. He insists that
Brougham has persuaded himself that this Government
cannot go on, and that in any fresh combination a Chancellor
will be wanted, and that somehow the Great Seal will
fall into his hands. Brougham made a display of more than
usual violence and indecency in the House of Lords last
night, and proved (if there was any doubt) how necessary it
is to have a Speaker to keep order there. He has really
made the House of Lords a bear-garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MORE BLUNDERS AT PARIS.</div>

<p>Normanby writes from Paris out of humour: he has lost
his senses and his temper; he harps querulously upon the
details of his miserable quarrel, and thinks the Government
have used him ill by not supporting him. He is writhing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
under the consciousness of cutting a poor figure, and of the
triumph Guizot has gained over him, but there is no end of
his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="clumsinesses">gaucheries</i>. When the quarrel was made up, and he
invited Guizot to dinner, he selected the day on which
Guizot himself always receives his friends. Guizot accepted,
and announced that he should not receive that day, but
of course the invitation was attributed either to stupidity or
to impertinence. St. Aulaire asked me, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Is it that it was a blunder, or did he do it on purpose?">Est-ce que c'était
une étourderie, ou l'a-t-il fait exprès?</span>' I assured him it
must have been an <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="careless mistake">étourderie</i>, but an unpardonable one.
What was graver, however, was that the first night of
Guizot's reception after the reconciliation, when he ought
to have taken care to go there, he went to Molé instead, and
never went to Guizot at all. However, John Russell is now
alive to foreign affairs, and his brother is keeping him up to
it. The Duke told me he wrote him six sheets on the subject
of our foreign relations, especially with France, '<i>very confidential</i>.'
The Government here are going on very well.
Lord John speaks excellently; the Speaker says he never
saw any Government do their business so well. Charles
Wood's success is an immense thing for them; a good
Chancellor of the Exchequer is a tower of strength to a
Government. Goulburn was only Peel's chief clerk; Wood
is taking a flight of his own. Every day strengthens the
Government by exhibiting the utter incapacity of the Opposition,
and the impossibility of any other Government being
formed; and people who have no party heat or prejudices
will have the best workmen; but there is a disposition to
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rebel">fronder</i> in some quarters. I observed to Lincoln, whom
I met, that the Government were going on very well, but he
would not admit it.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 14th.</i>&mdash;Saw Graham yesterday, and had a long
talk with him. He said John Russell's speech on the Irish
Poor Law was the best thing he had done since he was
Minister, and proved his competence for his high office;
that he viewed with the deepest alarm the measure itself,
but that, in the temper of the House of Commons and the
country, it was inevitable; the Government could have done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
nothing but what they have, and, having come to that resolution,
nothing could exceed the skill and judgement with
which John Russell has dealt with it, and his speech had
carried the question. He thinks the consequence will be
a complete revolution of property, the ruin of the landed
proprietors, and the downfall of Protestant ascendency and
of the Church. He expects that the first to abandon the
Church will be the Protestant proprietors themselves; that
a tremendous ordeal is to be gone through, involving vast
changes and social vicissitudes, but that on the whole, and
at a remote period, it will produce the regeneration of
Ireland. This, much elaborated, was the substance of his
opinion. I do not pretend to enunciate any opinion as to
the solution of this tremendous problem which gives rise to
so many thoughts&mdash;social, political, and religious&mdash;perplexing
the mind upon all. How those devout persons who are
accustomed to find in everything that happens manifestations
of divine goodness and wisdom, and are always overflowing
with thanksgiving and praise, accommodate this
awful and appalling reality with their ideas and convictions,
I do not divine. To me no difficulty is presented, because I
never have allowed my mind to be exposed to the hazard of
any such perplexity. I do not pretend to define the attributes,
nor to pass judgement on the counsels of God; '<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="I wrap my ignorance and weakness,">meâ
ignorantiâ et debilitate me involvo,</span>' and I submit and resign
myself, with an implicit and unrepining humility, to all
things that are decreed, public or private, without venturing
to pronounce an opinion, and without wishing to give vent
to a feeling on things which are far beyond the reach of any
human comprehension.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 23rd.</i>&mdash;Last week the political and commercial
world were struck with astonishment at the sudden and unexpected
announcement of a financial arrangement between
the Emperor of Russia and the Bank of France, of which
nobody, either politicians or financiers, could make head or
tail, nor up to this moment has any light been thrown upon
it.<a href="#Footnote_14" id="FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
Excursive and eager political minds, however, instantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
jumped to very vast conclusions, and beheld deep political designs,
a monstrous union between France and Russia, French
divisions crossing the Pyrenees, and Russian the Balkan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE OF IRELAND.</div>

<p>For the last week the accounts from Ireland have been
rather better, but the people are, without any doubt, perishing
by hundreds. The people of this country are animated
by very mixed and very varying feelings, according to the
several representations which are put before them, and are
tossed about between indignation, resentment, rage, and
economical fear on the one hand, and pity and generosity on
the other; and the circumstances of the case, which will
appear fabulous to after ages, will account for this. There
is no doubt whatever that, while English charity and commiseration
have been so loudly invoked, and we have been
harrowed with stories of Irish starvation, in many parts of
Ireland the people have been suffered to die for want of food,
when there was all the time plenty of food to give them, but
which was hoarded on speculation. But what is still more
extraordinary, people have died of starvation with money
enough to buy food in their pockets. I was told the night
before last that Lord de Vesci had written to his son that,
since the Government had positively declared they would
not furnish seed, abundance of seed had come forth, and,
what was more extraordinary, plenty of potatoes; and Labouchere
told me there had been three coroner's inquests,
with verdicts 'starvation,' and in each case the sufferers had
been found to have considerable sums of money in their
possession, and in one (if not more) still more considerable
sums in the savings bank: yet they died rather than spend
their money in the purchase of food.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 31st.</i>&mdash;George Bentinck made another exhibition
in the House of Commons the night before last in the shape
of an attack on Labouchere more violent and disgusting
than any of his previous ones. He seems to have lost all
command over his temper, and his indiscretion and arrogance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
have excited a bitterness against him not to be described.
The Protectionists are overwhelmed with shame and chagrin,
and they know not what to do: he has ruined them as a
party; he was hooted even by those who sat behind him,
and all the signs of disapprobation with which he was
assailed only excited and enraged him the more. The
Government are now anxious to dissolve as soon as they
possibly can, justly thinking that the time is very ripe for
them. There is at this moment certainly no party spirit, no
zeal and animation in any quarter, and there are neither
great principles nor measures in dispute to serve as war cries
or rallying points. The only party, therefore, that has any
interest in exerting itself is that of the Government, who
naturally wish to keep the power of which they have got
possession. The Irish Poor Law Bill is going through the
House of Commons with hardly any opposition, and everybody,
willingly or unwillingly, has made up his mind that
the great experiment must be tried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRTHDAY REFLEXIONS.</div>

<p>The Government meanwhile are in a state of great uneasiness
at the condition of foreign affairs<a href="#Footnote_15" id="FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> in almost every
quarter of the world&mdash;in Spain, Portugal, and Greece particularly;
in Switzerland, in Italy, and Germany to a less
degree; and they are not only in a state of uneasiness, but in
one of extreme perplexity, because they by no means clearly
see their way or have any accurate knowledge of the designs
and objects of the different European Powers; they think,
however, that France is now willing to let the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="entente">entente</i> with
England drop, and is disposed to form connexions with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Russia and Austria in a sort of semi-hostility to England,
and by a mutual connivance at each other's objects. They
suspect, without being sure of it, that the recent financial
operation has a deeper political significance, and that the
object of France is to secure the neutrality of Russia and
Austria in the affairs of Spain, and to repay it by suffering
the Austrians to coerce the Pope and put down the rising
spirit of Italian improvement. Then the condition of Spain
and Portugal excites the greatest apprehension, and the more
because it is evident we do not know what we can or what
we ought to do. I never saw people so perplexed and with
so little of fixed ideas or settled intentions on the subject.</p>

<p>I met the Archbishop of Dublin, Whately, at dinner
yesterday at Raikes Currie's. I don't think him at all
agreeable; he has a skimble-skamble way of talking as if he
was half tipsy, and the stories he tells are abominably long
and greatly deficient in point.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;My birthday: a day of no joy to me, and
which I always gladly hasten over. There is no pleasure
in reaching one's fifty-third year and in a retrospect full of
shame and a prospect without hope; for shameful it is to
have wasted one's faculties, and to have consumed in idleness
and frivolous, if not mischievous pleasures that time
which, if well employed, might have produced good fruit
full of honour and of real, solid, permanent satisfaction.
And what is there to look forward to at my time of life?
Nothing but increasing infirmities, and the privations and
distresses which they will occasion. I trust I shall have fortitude
and resignation enough to meet them, and I pray that
I may be cut off and be at rest before I am exposed to any
great trials. When we have no longer the faculty and the
means of enjoyment in this life, it is better to quit it. With
regard to that great future, the object of all men's hopes,
fears, and speculations, I reject nothing and admit nothing.</p>

<p>I believe in God, who has given us in the wonders of

creation irresistible&mdash;to my mind at least irresistible&mdash;evidence
of His existence. All other evidences offered by
men claiming to have divine legations and authority, are,
to me, imperfect and inconclusive. To the will of God I
submit myself with implicit resignation. I try to find out
the truth, and the best conclusions at which my mind can
arrive are really <i>truth</i> to me. However, I will not write
an essay now and here. Sometimes I think of writing on
religious subjects amongst the many others which it occurs
to me to handle. Ever since I wrote my book on Ireland, I
have been longing to write again, and for more than one
reason: first, the hope of again writing something that the
world may think worth reading; secondly, because the
occupation is very interesting and agreeable, inasmuch as it
furnishes a constant object and something specific to do;
and thirdly, because I find that nothing but having a subject
in hand which renders enquiry and investigation in some
particular line necessary is sufficient to conquer idleness.
Mere desultory reading does not conquer it, and there is
a want of satisfaction in reading without an object. Why
then do I not write, when I am conscious that I have a very
tolerable power of expressing myself? It is because I am
also conscious that I want knowledge, familiarity with books,
recollection sufficiently accurate of the little I have read, and
that facility of composition which extensive information and
the habit of using it alone can give. It is when this struggle
is going on in my mind between the desire to write and the
sense of incapacity, that I feel so bitterly the consequences
of my imperfect education, and my lazy, unprofitable habits.
But no more of this now. To-morrow I am going to Newmarket
to begin another year of the old pursuits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POWER OF THE PRESS.</div>

<p>I dined with David Dundas the Solicitor-General the day
before yesterday at the Clarendon Hotel: splendid banquet;
twenty miscellaneous friends. Labouchere there told me
that Lord Hatherton had not long ago shown him Dudley's
diary, which is very curious.<a href="#Footnote_16" id="FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> It was very regularly kept,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
and told of everything he did, giving minute details of his
adventures both in high and low life. Certainly nothing
could be more injudicious than to commit to paper and to
leave behind him such memorials as these, and accordingly
Labouchere advised Hatherton to commit the MS. to the
flames. Dudley speaks of his friends, and even of his
acquaintances generally, in a very good-natured spirit, and
of himself with modesty and diffidence. He was in a
dreadful state of nervousness whenever he had to make a
speech in Parliament. He felt very bitterly against his
father, who, he thought, had ruined his prospects and
character by the way he had brought him up. I hope
Hatherton will not burn this MS., and that I shall some
day manage to see it.</p>

<p>Yesterday Le Marchant told me an anecdote illustrative
of the power of the press. He called late one night many
years ago on Barnes at his house, and while there another
visitor arrived whom he did not see, but who was shown into
another room. Barnes went to him and after a quarter of
an hour returned, when Le Marchant said, 'Shall I tell you
who your visitor is?' Barnes said yes, if he knew. 'Well,
then, I know his step and his voice; it is Lord Durham.'
Barnes owned it was, when Le Marchant said, 'What does
he come for?' Barnes said he came on behalf of King
Leopold, who had been much annoyed by some article in the
'Times,' to entreat they would put one in of a contrary and
healing description. As Le Marchant said, here was the
proudest man in England come to solicit the editor of a
newspaper for a crowned head!</p>

<p>Moxon told me on Wednesday that some years ago
Disraeli had asked him to take him into partnership, but
he refused, not thinking he was sufficiently prudent to be
trusted. He added he did not know how Dizzy would like
to be reminded of that now.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 10th.</i>&mdash;Just before I left town last week I saw
Arbuthnot, who entreated me, if I had any influence with the
Government, to get them to take up the subject of the defence
of the country. He said it haunted the Duke of Wellington,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
and deprived him of rest, and night and day he was occupied
with the unhappy state of our foreign relations, the danger
of war, and the defenceless state of our coasts. He afterwards
wrote to the Duke of Bedford on that, as well as
about the Enlistment Bill, the provisions of which he does
not approve of. The Duke of Bedford spoke to me about
these things, and we agreed that it was desirable Lord John
should see the Duke of Wellington very soon, and come to
some understanding with him. On the defences, Lord John
agrees in the propriety of doing what the Duke wants, but
he thinks the danger of war is not imminent, and that it is
better to do what is necessary gradually and without noise.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 18th.</i>&mdash;In consequence of the communications between
the Duke of Bedford, Arbuthnot and me, Lord John
saw the Duke of Wellington and has come to an agreement
with him. The Duke will support their Enlistment Bill,
and they give way to him in what he wished about the
pensioners. Arbuthnot told me that the Duke was rather
surprised that Lord John did not mention the subject of the
defence of the country, nor tell him if he had seen the letters
he has lately written to Lord Anglesey on that subject. It
is impossible to describe his anxiety or his indignation at the
supineness of the Government and the country in reference
to this matter. What he wants is that the militia shall be
called out, and 20,000 men added to the regular army, but
this latter he knows he cannot hope for. His letters to Lord
Anglesey are very strong. The Duke knows that some of
the Cabinet entirely take his views; the subject has been
brought before them, and Clarendon and Palmerston are as
strong in this sense as the Duke himself. The Chancellor of
the Exchequer is against anything expensive. Lord John
seems to have been rather neutral. The Duke attributes all
the obstacles his plans encounter to Grey; however, it seems
probable that something will be done. Lord John will act,
though not so rapidly or decisively as the Duke wishes.</p>

to them. Some time ago Clarendon wanted to propose to
France a joint interference and mediation with Spain, to
settle the miserable quarrel which is ruining the country.
The Cabinet would not agree to it, Palmerston being always
against France, and the others disinclined to make any proposals
to the French Government; but now they find out
that they are wrong and that they had better have done this
at first, for France has offered the Portuguese Government
its assistance or interference, and the knowledge of this has
induced us to make the proposal now which we had better
have done long ago. It was an excellent opportunity for
renewing amicable relations with France, properly, prudently,
and without affectation.<a href="#Footnote_17" id="FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 30th.</i>&mdash;Troubles and difficulties of various kinds
have not diminished since I wrote last. The state of Ireland
continues not only as bad, but as unpromising as ever, and,
in addition, there is the great misfortune, public and private,
of the approaching death of Lord Bessborough, the Lord
Lieutenant. His illness was very sudden, at least the
dangerous symptoms were, and he is dying amidst universal
sympathy and regret. Lord John has made up his mind
as to his successor, but without telling his colleagues his
intentions; he may have told some, but certainly not all,
for he has not told Clarendon, with whom he is on very
confidential terms.<a href="#Footnote_18" id="FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
The Duke of Bedford told Clarendon
Lord John had talked it all over with him, and had settled
what to do, but that he was not at liberty to reveal his
intentions. This is acting independently and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="authoritatively">en maître</i>.</p>

<p>The other night the Enlistment Bill was debated in the
House of Lords, and the Government got a small majority
by the aid of the Peelite peers. The Opposition were full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of eagerness and heat on this Bill and quite persuaded
that the Duke of Wellington was with them. He had
certainly given them to understand that he was so. Last
week Stanley and Richmond were at Newmarket, and one
day after dinner at the Duke of Rutland's we talked it
over. I said they would find the Duke was not opposed to
the Bill. 'Then,' said Stanley, 'he must be very much
changed since I talked to him about it. There can be no
secret as to what passed, because three or four people were
present. I said to him, "Pray, sir, what is the necessity
for this Bill?" and he said, "I'll tell you: they have got
a d&mdash;&mdash;d good army, and they want to make it a d&mdash;&mdash;d bad
one."' This, which was very characteristic, might very
well convince Stanley and the rest that he was against Grey's
measure, as, in fact, and in spite of this support, he really is,
but he came to an agreement with the Government and
promised to speak in favour of the Bill. So he did, but he
spoke in such a way that though the Opposition were surprised
and vexed at his supporting it at all, they saw pretty
clearly that he did not like it, and they accordingly were not
deterred from voting against it. Ellesmere told me yesterday
that the Government must not attempt to try any fresh
experiments with the army, for if they did the Duke would
certainly resign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEENS OF SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.</div>

<p>Affairs in Spain and Portugal are in a very strange
state. The young Queen of Spain exhibits some character
and some talent, but she is unsteady and uneducated. The
turn matters have taken at Madrid is, however, enough to
provoke and annoy the French, while every day exhibits
more and more the infamy and disgrace of the marriage
which the French Government forced upon the Queen. Her
husband is a wretched imbecile sulky fanatic, who passes
his life in trying to make embarrassments for the Queen,
and in praying to the shade of his mother to forgive him
for having married the usurper of his cousin's throne. They
have been endeavouring to effect the semblance of a reconciliation
between them, but he is incurably sulky, and will
not make it up. Not long ago he sent for Pacheco, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
told him it was his desire that a Council should be convened
forthwith. Pacheco said very well, but begged His Majesty
would be so good as to tell him for what purpose he wished
for it. The King replied that his object was to lay before
the Council proofs of the Queen's infidelity to him. Pacheco
said if that was his object he must beg to decline to summon
the Council. On this he announced that he had prepared a
manifesto to the nation setting forth his wrongs, and that
it should be immediately published. They persuaded him
to desist from this scandalous intention, and as a sort of
compromise they got Serrano to quit Madrid. It appears
that the Queen-mother, seeing how matters were going on,
intended to return; but her daughter had no mind she
should, and told her Ministers they had better look to it.
It was their affair, but that if Mama came back matters
would go ill. On this they sent Concha to Paris to stop
her. Christina wrote Isabella a lecture on her proceedings,
and told her that she was too little educated to know how
to conduct herself properly, to which she replied, 'Mama
knows that I did not educate myself.' However, everything
is in a state of the greatest doubt and uncertainty there,
and the French are sure to begin their intrigues again and
to create as much confusion as they can.</p>

<p>In Portugal, the other Queen continues as obstinate as
ever, yielding inch by inch as the danger approaches her
more nearly, and is supported in her obstinacy by the security
she is still able to find in foreign intervention. We have
anchored our ships close to the town, and are prepared to
land our Marines to protect her person, and, thus knowing she
is personally safe, she is emboldened to refuse or demur to the
terms of accommodation which Palmerston has suggested,
and to try on the chances of war totally regardless, of course,
of the misery of prolonging the contest. The natural course
for us to take would be to offer our mediation, and if she
refused it to withdraw our ships and leave her to her fate.
But we cannot do this, because if we were to desert her the
Spaniards and French would instantly step in and reconquer
her kingdom for her. Such is the <i class="grn" lang="it" xml:lang="it" title="developed knot">nodo sviluppato</i> in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
these wretched affairs are involved. Lisbon is ready to rise
in insurrection the moment the army of the Junta makes
its appearance. Southern writes very curious accounts to
Clarendon of the state of the town. The jealousy and aversion
of the Queen of Portugal to him have compelled him to
withdraw altogether from the affairs of the mission, though
he is still Secretary of Legation. Our Court continues to
take the same interest in the Lisbon Coburgs, and would
willingly interfere in their favour with more vigour if the
Ministers would consent to do so. Palmerston's defects
prove rather useful in his intercourse with the Court. To
their wishes or remonstrances he expresses the greatest
deference, and then goes on in his own course without
paying the least attention to what they have been saying
to him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>May 2nd.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning the Duke of Bedford
called on me, and told me Lord John's secret intentions
about Ireland, which he said he had not yet imparted to
any of the Cabinet, and only discussed with him. I believe,
however, that Lord John has told Labouchere, and nobody
else. He thinks of taking this opportunity of abolishing
the office of Lord-Lieutenant and making a Secretary of
State for Ireland, who is not to reside permanently but go
there occasionally, and he destines this office for Clarendon.
This is his plan, which, however, he has by no means determined
on, and they both think it doubtful if it would do.
The moment, however, seems propitious for effecting this
alteration; there is no O'Connell either to inveigh against
it or to seize any power that may be, or appear to be,
relinquished, and the difficulty of selecting a successor to Lord
Bessborough is so great as to be almost insuperable. Meanwhile
the town is full of reports about a new Lord-Lieutenant,
nobody dreaming of what Lord John is resolving in his mind.
Everybody has got some story (<i>from the best authority</i>) of the
post having been offered to this person, and pressed upon
that. Bessborough still lingers on, and a more striking and
touching deathbed has seldom been seen. He is surrounded
by the whole of his numerous family, overwhelmed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
affliction, a general manifestation of sympathy and regret,
and the deep sense which is entertained of the loss which
the country will sustain by his death, afford the best and
most feeling testimony to his capacity and his merit. He
is perfectly aware of his condition, and in full possession of
his faculties. Duncannon wrote to John Russell yesterday,
as I am told, an admirable letter, which was sent to the
Queen. Bessborough was bent upon writing himself to
John Russell before he died, and was preparing to do so.
Certainly a greater loss both public and private has seldom
occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LORD-LIEUTENANCY OF IRELAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 3rd.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford came here this morning.
They now find there are immense difficulties in the way of
abolishing the office of Lord-Lieutenant at present; they are
assured that if it was proposed the Repealers would raise a
furious clamour and be joined by the Orangemen. Some
Irishman (he did not tell me who), a sensible man and
favourable to the abolition, tells him and Lord John this,
consequently Lord John has told the Duke that <i>his</i> going
there would be the only solution of the difficulty. This difficulty,
he says, is enormous and increasing; that everything
tends to prove that dangers are thickening round them, and
that next year they will have to propose measures that will
be very unpopular. Bessborough has dictated to Lord John
a most affecting letter; his daughter, Lady Emily, wrote
also, saying that her father was so weak that he was scarcely
intelligible, and she was not sure she had quite faithfully
written what he had dictated, but that she had given the
substance of it as well as she could. He tells Lord John
that the dangers and difficulties are very great, and that he
foresees their increase, and he expects him to appoint a man
to succeed him who shall be firm and bold, and, above all,
who will not seek for popularity. I found the Duke most
unwilling, and almost, but not quite, decided not to go. He
will go if Lord John insists on it, but he dreads and shrinks
from it; neither his health, nerves, nor spirits are equal to such
a task. The principal reason for his going is, that he alone
can go temporarily, and Lord John does not contemplate his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
remaining. Lord John says he cannot ask Clarendon to go
on account of the expense, unless he was to stay there for
three years. He says that not one of the men who have been
mentioned will do for the office, especially Morpeth; and he
thinks Bessborough's warning as to the sort of man they
ought to choose was intended to point at Morpeth as the one
they ought not to appoint. Morpeth himself is longing to go.
'It is now come to this,' the Duke said: 'it must be either
Clarendon, myself, or Lords Justices.' He went from me to
Clarendon to talk it over with him. Grey and Labouchere are
the only members of the Cabinet to whom he has mentioned
the matter. The Duke has had a long confidential letter
from Arbuthnot about the Duke of Wellington, and his dread
of Grey and his reforms, the object of it being to deter the
Government from attempting anything else. It is clear they
have dragged the Duke with them as far as he can be persuaded
to go, and if they try anything more, and make any
further attempts on his patience or condescension, he will
then turn restive and resign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD BESSBOROUGH.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 7th.</i><a href="#Footnote_19" id="FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>&mdash;More
than a month has elapsed since I have
written anything, and from the usual cause, that of having
been occupied with Epsom, Ascot, and Newmarket. The
principal events which have occurred have been the deaths
of Bessborough and O'Connell, which took place almost at
the same time, within a day or two of one another. The
departure of the latter, which not long ago would have
excited the greatest interest and filled the world with political
speculations, was heard almost with unconcern, so
entirely had his importance vanished; he had in fact been
for some time morally and politically defunct, and nobody
seems to know whether his death is likely to prove a good
or an evil, or a mere matter of indifference. The death of
Bessborough excited far greater interest, and no man ever
quitted the world more surrounded by sympathy, approbation,
respect, and affection, than he did. During his last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
illness, which he himself and all about him knew to be fatal,
he was surrounded by a numerous and devoted family, and
the people of Dublin universally testified their regard for
him, and their grief at losing him. He continued in the
uninterrupted possession of his faculties almost to the last
hour of his existence, and he calmly discussed every matter
of public and private interest, in conversation with his children
and friends, or dictating letters to John Russell and
his colleagues at home. He expired at eleven o'clock at
night; at nine he felt his pulse and said he saw the end
was approaching. He then sent for all his family, seventeen
in number, saw them and took leave of them separately, and
gave to each a small present he had prepared, and then
calmly lay down to die; in less than two hours all was over.
They say that his funeral was one of the finest and most
striking sights possible from the countless multitudes which
attended it, and the decorum and good feeling which were
displayed. Clarendon has kept the whole of Bessborough's
staff and household, with one exception; and he told them
that he kept them on account of their attachment to his
predecessor.</p>

<p>The reputation which Bessborough had acquired, which
at the time of his death and since his Irish administration
was very considerable, affords a remarkable example
of the success which may be obtained by qualities of a
superior description, without great talents, without knowledge
and information, and without any power of speaking
in Parliament. He had long been addicted to politics, and
was closely connected by relationship or friendship with the
most eminent Whig leaders. His opinions had always been
strongly Liberal, and he seemed to have found the place
exactly adapted to his capacity and disposition when he
became the Whig whipper-in of the House of Commons; he
was gradually initiated in all the secrets of that party, and
he soon became a very important member of it from his
various intimacies and the personal influence he was enabled
to exercise. He had a remarkably calm and unruffled temper
and very good sound sense. The consequence was that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
was consulted by everybody, and usually and constantly
employed in the arrangement of difficulties, the adjustment
of rival pretensions, and the reconciliation of differences, for
which purposes some such man is indispensable and invaluable
in every great political association. He continued to
acquire fresh weight and influence, and at length nothing
could be done without Duncannon as he then was. Everybody
liked him, and King William, when he hated the rest
of the Whigs, always testified good humour and regard for
him. He took office and became a Cabinet Minister, and he
contrived to do a vast deal of Parliamentary business, especially
in the House of Lords, and carry bills through Parliament
without ever making the semblance of a speech. In
this way by his good nature and good sense, and an extreme
liveliness and elasticity of spirits, which made him a very
pleasant and acceptable member of society, he continued to
increase in public reputation and private favour, and when
the Government was formed last year, his appointment to
the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland was generally approved of.
He had almost always been on good terms with O'Connell,
indeed he never was on bad terms with anybody; and as an
Irishman he was agreeable to the people. In his administration,
adverse and unhappy as the times were, he displayed
great industry, firmness, and knowledge of the character
and circumstances of the Irish people, and he conciliated
the good will of those to whom he had been all his life
opposed. Lord Roden, the head of the Orange party, who
has all along acted a very honourable and patriotic part,
afforded ample testimony to his merits, and gave him a very
frank and generous support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CLARENDON GOES TO IRELAND.</div>

<p>There was a great pother for some time before his death
about a successor. The candidates soon became reduced to
three, though candidates they must not be called; that is,
the choice lay between the Duke of Bedford, Clarendon, and
Morpeth. Lord John communicated with the Duke and
with Labouchere upon the subject, and perhaps with Lord
Lansdowne, and, for a long time, he rather leant to the Duke's
going, and tried to persuade him, not, however, without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
misgivings; but he thought it not fair to ask Clarendon,
and he had no mind to send Morpeth, who was dying to
go. The Duke was rather tickled at the idea of the appointment,
somewhat encouraged by the numerous invitations he
received to take it, but desperately afraid of it all the time.
To my surprise he did not absolutely reject it, as I thought he
would have done. In this wavering and uncertain state of
mind he broached the matter to Clarendon, who affected to
repudiate it and to dread and dislike it, and urged the Duke
to go himself. I say <i>affected</i>, because it soon became very
clear to me, as it did to the Duke, that Clarendon had no
disinclination to go, and would in fact be excessively mortified
and disappointed if anybody went but himself. The
play of human nature was amusing; the Duke was not quite
willing to give it up, but much more afraid to go, and he
enjoyed mightily all the expressions of a desire that he
should be Lord-Lieutenant, which were addressed to him
from various quarters; on the other hand, Clarendon treated
it as a sacrifice and a misfortune; hesitated, objected, and
did everything to make it appear as if it were a painful
burthen cast upon him, but he was all the time in a great
fright lest the Duke should be persuaded to accept it, and he
said, and made me say to him, that one of his principal
motives for accepting it himself was his desire to save the
Duke from a burthen which would, he was sure, break him
down with anxiety and labour. A great deal of time was
wasted and much useless talk expended in fictitious fears
and scruples, but at last it was settled that he should go, as
it might just as well have been without any fuss or difficulty,
for the truth is that he is the fittest man, and is universally
considered so. Nothing can be more flattering and gratifying
than the reception he has met with from all ranks and all
parties, and he is now (whatever doubts or misgivings he
may have had, and, in spite of his secret wishes, he probably
had some) quite satisfied with his appointment.</p>

<p>The death of O'Connell, I have said, made little or no
sensation here. He had quarrelled with half of his followers,
he had ceased to be the head of a great party animated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
by any great principle, or encouraged to pursue any attainable
object; the Repeal cause was become despicable
and hopeless without ceasing to be noisy and mischievous.
O'Connell knew not what to say or what to do; he had
become bankrupt in reputation and in power, and was no
longer able to do much good or much harm; broken in health
and spirits, and seeing Ireland penetrated by famine and
sickness, and reduced to a condition of helpless dependence
on England, having lost a great part of his <i>prestige</i> in Ireland
without having gained respect or esteem in England, he
went away unregretted and unnoticed to breathe his last in
a foreign land. He was received everywhere on his route
with the marks of respect and admiration which were considered
due to his wonderful career and to the great part he
had played in the history of his country, and his memory has
been treated with some appearance of affection in Ireland,
and with a decent respect and forbearance here. History
will speak of him as one of the most remarkable men who
ever existed; he will fill a great space in its pages; his
position was unique; there never was before, and there
never will be again, anything at all resembling it. To rise
from the humblest situation to the height of empire like
Napoleon is no uncommon destiny; there have been innumerable
successful adventurers and usurpers; but there
never was a man who, without altering his social position in
the slightest degree, without obtaining any office or station
whatever, raised himself to a height of political power which
gave him an enormous capacity for good or evil, and made
him the most important and most conspicuous man of his
time and country. It would not be a very easy matter to do
him perfect justice. A careful examination of his career
and an accurate knowledge of his character would be necessary
for the purpose. It is impossible to question the greatness
of his abilities or the sincerity of his patriotism. His
dependence on his country's bounty, in the rent that was
levied for so many years, was alike honourable to the contributors
and the recipient; it was an income nobly given
and nobly earned. Up to the conquest of Catholic Emancipation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
his was certainly a great and glorious career. What he
might have done and what he ought to have done after that,
it is not easy to say, but undoubtedly he did far more mischief
than good, and exhibited anything but a wise, generous,
and patriotic spirit. In Peel's administration he did nothing
but mischief, and it is difficult to comprehend with what
object and what hope he threw Ireland into confusion, and
got up that Repeal agitation, the folly and impracticability
of which nobody must have known so well as himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNOR-GENERALSHIP OF INDIA.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 14th.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford has been telling me
what has been going on about India and the appointment of
Hardinge's successor. In the first place Normanby has been
making desperate attempts to get it, but Lord John will not
hear of it, and believes the Directors would object to him if
he was proposed. Lord John is resolved that this great
appointment shall not be made an affair of party, and he
desired the Chairs to furnish him with a list of the persons
they would consider most eligible for the office of Governor-General
without distinction of party. They sent him four
or five names&mdash;Clarendon, Graham, I think Dalhousie, and
the others I forget, but Normanby's was not among them.
Lord John has made up his mind to offer the post to
Graham, and has communicated his intention to the Duke
of Wellington, at the same time consulting him about the
military appointment. The Duke approves of Graham, and
proposes Sir George Napier for Commander-in-Chief, to
which Lord John agrees. Normanby, who had a suspicion
that Graham was thought of, from something the Duke of
Bedford had said to him, wrote him a long letter, strongly
arguing against this appointment, and not a very bad argument
either. Meanwhile I have seen Graham, and had a
long conversation with him. It began about the Portuguese
question, which is now going on in the House of Commons;
but after discussing this and some electioneering matters, I
asked him what his own projects were. He said he was
indifferent about them and had settled nothing. I said,
'You know that it is reported in the world that you are
likely to go to India.' He said he had three times refused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
to go there; that it would always be a matter of much doubt
and deliberation, both on private and public grounds, whether
he should accept it if offered; but at present it was out of
the question, for Lord John Russell was evidently animated
by very implacable sentiments towards him, and he never
would take an office from him while he was in such a disposition,
and when the appointment would be clearly offered
at the suggestion of others, and not by his own free will.
He then talked a great deal about the feeling which subsisted
between himself and the Whigs&mdash;of their resentment
towards him; of the way in which he had been
persecuted by them; of Lord John's sending for him in
the autumn of 1845; about the change of government; how
gratified he had been; how frankly he had behaved; how
desirous he had been to give every aid in his power to his
successor; how generally friendly to the Government, of
which he gave instances; and then how hurt he had been at
the bitterness and severity of Lord John's attack upon him
in reply to his speech objecting to the exclusion of Catholics
from the grant; that that speech had proved to him that
Lord John's dislike of him was unmitigated and unappeasable.
This is a very brief summary of a long discourse he
made to me on the subject. I told him he was mistaken in
Lord John's sentiments, which were by no means so bitter
and hostile as he imagined, and on the occasion he alluded
to, Lord John had spoken under great irritation and with
strong resentment, thinking that Graham had made a most
offensive and unjust speech, and that he had most unfairly
done his best to embarrass the Government; that such was
the general opinion of Lord John's friends, and I would not
conceal from him my own opinion; that his speech had been
calculated to produce that effect; that it had appeared to
many people, to me amongst them, that Peel had been
conscious of the effect produced by his (Graham's) speech,
and had spoken, as he did, in a very different tone to repair
the effect of it. He must not therefore infer from the
vivacity of Lord John's tone on that occasion that he was
animated by such sentiments as he ascribed to him; that I did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
not mean to say he had any feelings of extreme cordiality;
but I had reason to know that he rendered ample justice to his
public character and capacity, and felt no bitterness towards
him; that some day I would give him proofs of the truth of
what I said, but that in the meantime I must beg him to
take my word for it; and I entreated him not to deceive
himself by the exaggerated, and, I was convinced, unfounded
notion he entertained of Lord John's disposition.
A great deal passed on this subject, and I found that he was
very low and very much vexed, both on the above ground and
about a very mortifying communication that had been made
to him about Cumberland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CUMBERLAND ELECTION.</div>

<p>Aglionby had informed him they were going to put up
Charles Howard and William Marshall, which was an intimation
that that they would not have him. He replied that
he would not pledge himself about the two candidates, but
would support Howard, saying civil things about Lord
Carlisle and the whole family. The other day he got a
letter, not very judiciously worded&mdash;cold, but intended to
be civil&mdash;from Morpeth, announcing that he was going to
support the <i>two</i> candidates on his own side of the House,
accompanied with some expression of regret that his support
could not rather have been given to him. Graham took
this very ill, and was evidently excessively hurt at the way
in which he was thus excluded from the representation. All
these things were evidently souring his mind, and I strongly
suspect stimulating him to act an unfriendly part in the
Portuguese discussion, and I was therefore very glad that I
had an opportunity of saying what I did, for I said quite
enough to let him see that India is full in view, and I do not
think he will now do anything to mar this prospect. He
would not tell me what he or Peel meant to do, and Peel
happens to be exceedingly out of humour in consequence
of young Campbell's speech at Cambridge; so is Graham.
Graham told me he never saw Peel so put out and so angry
with anything, and they are the more so because old Jack
(Lord Campbell) went down, they say, to Cambridge with his
son.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 19th.</i>&mdash;I was obliged to break off in the midst of the
above conversation, and have since been out of town. I told
the Duke of Bedford all that had passed between Graham
and me, and advised that Lord John should show him
some civility, which he undertook that he should do. On
Tuesday evening the Portuguese discussion was resumed in
the Commons and came on in the Lords. I went down to
hear Stanley speak, never having heard him before. His
style and manner, fluency and expression, are admirable,
and he speaks with an appearance of earnestness, even of
dignity, that is marvellously striking; but nothing could be
more injudicious than his speech, and I was as much disappointed
with the matter of it as I was charmed with the
manner. Never was there so ridiculous and contemptible an
ending to an affair begun with such a flourish of trumpets
and note of preparation, and which for a moment put the
Government into a state of alarm. The whippers-in in
both Houses had collected all their forces, and when the
House of Lords met, a long night and a doubtful division
were announced.</p>

<p>The first thing that happened was that Peel made an
admirable speech in the House of Commons, strong in defence
of Government, and without any 'buts' or drawbacks. He
spoke very early. Very few people were there, and many
went away after; so, finding the House in this state, George
Bentinck made Newdigate count it out, and the whole thing
thus fell to the ground. This he considered a very skilful
piece of jockeyship, apparently unconscious of the ridicule
which it cast on the whole affair. Great was the astonishment
in the Lords when news was brought that the House of
Commons had been counted out. Stanley had gone home to
dinner, and after a few insignificant speeches (the Duke of
Wellington having spoken strongly for the Government)
nobody seemed disposed to go on. Clarendon went to Ellenborough
and to Brougham, and asked them if they would
not speak: both declined; the latter said it was very dull and
he should say nothing. Accordingly they divided, many on
both sides absent, and Government had a majority of twenty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Stanley was not present, and when he came back to the
House found it all over. So ended this solemn farce. Stanley
would have beaten the Government if he could, and have
thought it very good fun, trusting to the majority he knew
they would have in the Commons to induce them to put up
with a defeat. Lord John, however, was not disposed to
take it so quietly, and there can be very little doubt that
Brougham and the rest saw that a division against Government
in the Lords without any division for them in the
Commons would make matters very different, and the sudden
termination of the debate in the other House greatly
cooled their ardour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WYATT'S STATUE OF THE DUKE.</div>

<p>The other day I met John Russell in the Park as he was
going to Apsley House by appointment with the Duke. He
said he was going on important business (it was about the
Indian appointments), and he asked me if I thought he had
better say anything to him or not about the Statue.<a href="#Footnote_20" id="FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> I said
'Better not.' The Duke of Bedford told me after that it
was very fortunate advice I gave Lord John, for if he had
said anything there would have been an explosion. The
Duke said to Arbuthnot, when Lord John wrote to say he
wished to see him, 'What can he want? what can he be
coming about? do you think it is about the Statue?' and
then he went off on that sore subject, and said he should place
his resignation in Lord John's hands! However, Lord John
said nothing about it, and the Duke was put into great good
humour by being consulted about the Indian affairs; and he
said afterwards that he only wished they would get the
pedestal made, put the Statue up, and have done with it.
But it is curious, as showing how sensitive and irritable he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
is become, how the strong mind is weakened. He is, however,
very happy on the whole, in excellent health, and
treated with the greatest deference and attention by everybody.
The Queen is excessively kind to him. On Monday
his grand-daughter was christened at the Palace, and the
Queen dined with him in the evening. She had written him
a very pretty letter expressing her wish to be godmother to
the child, saying she wished her to be called Victoria, which
name was so peculiarly appropriate to a grand-daughter of
his. All these attentions marvellously please him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford told me he wanted to
speak to me. I called on him, and he said, 'I wish you
would see Graham again; a good deal has passed; I won't
tell you what now, but I am curious to know what he will
say to you in reference to his last conversation.' I accordingly
called on Graham; he talked incessantly <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="of everything">de omnibus
rebus</i>, but never alluded to Lord John or himself, or
India, or to what I had before said to him. I had considerable
difficulty in getting anything in, but at last, just as I
was going and seeing he was resolved to say nothing, I said
'I hope you have thought on what I said to you the other
day, for I am quite certain I was right.' He broke in 'Oh,
no, that is quite impossible,' and then began again upon
Ireland, evidently determined to avoid the former subject.
I returned to the Duke and told him what had passed
between us, when with some difficulty I got him to tell me
what had occurred. As soon as the Portuguese debate was
over, Lord John wrote to Graham a very kind and handsome
letter, and offered him India, saying that he wished to forget
all their differences and only to remember that they had
been colleagues in Lord Grey's Government. Graham asked
leave to consult Peel, who at once put an extinguisher upon
it, entreated him to decline it, and said that their support of
the Government would be considered to have been given in
reference to this appointment. Peel gave many reasons,
which I now forget, against his taking it, and (as I suspect
very reluctantly) Graham did decline the offer, of course
with many expressions of gratitude and gratification. Peel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
himself said nothing could be handsomer than the offer.
Lord John, however, would not accept the refusal as final,
and caused Graham to be informed that he should not
appoint anybody else, but wait and see what might occur.
Graham might not get a seat in the next Parliament, or the
reasons which now influenced him might cease to exist; he
would, therefore, not fill up the office till Sir John Hobhouse
told him it was absolutely necessary to do so. So the matter
stands at present. It is a profound secret only communicated
'to <i>some</i> of the Cabinet,' and Graham has not even
told his wife. No wonder he was so reserved with me,
though the Duke thinks he might as well have said that he
was satisfied my opinion of Lord John's sentiments towards
him was correct. Graham, who is always in the garret or in
the cellar, was in such spirits the other day as compared with
the day before, that it was easy to see something agreeable
had happened to him. He talked of all sorts of things: poor
laws, railroads, abolition of Lord-Lieutenancy, very good
sense and friendly to the Government; said that they had
been unlucky in Strutt's appointment, of which great things
had been expected and which was a complete failure, and he
strongly advised the Government should not persist in their
Bill this year.<a href="#Footnote_21" id="FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
I told the Duke of Bedford this, and I find
the Bill was withdrawn last night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFERS TO SIR JAMES GRAHAM.</div>

<p>It is very curious how jealously and anxiously Peel's
actions and disposition are scanned, and amusing to hear
what people say of them. Bonham went to Arbuthnot the
other day, and told him Peel was getting up a party, and
expected to have 250 people in the next Parliament. Then
Lady Westmorland went and told him that Peel had told
her he had 120 followers in the House of Commons, and
that he alone kept the Government in office. They put
these things together, and inferred all sorts of deep designs
and ambitious projects on his part. Arbuthnot told the
Duke of Bedford, who told me. I laughed at them, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
said that probably what Bonham and Lady Westmorland
reported was false or exaggerated, and it was better to look
at Peel's acts and see how they corresponded with such supposed
intentions. He disclaims being the leader of any party
at all, <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="in as many words">totidem verbis</i>, and the other day he did not tell anybody
what he was going to do. His speech was calculated
to strengthen the Government, and to render them independent,
whereas his policy would be to weaken them, if he had
such designs as are imputed to him. I told Graham what I
had heard, and what I had said. He said, 'Peel's position
is a very extraordinary one, and he is determined to enjoy
it. He has an immense fortune, is in full possession of his
faculties and vigour, has great influence and consideration
in Parliament and in the country; he has shown the world
that he is <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="capable of ruling">capax imperii</i>. In this position he will not retire
from public life to please any man; he does not want to be
the head of a party, still less to return to office, but he will
continue to take that part in public affairs which he considers
best for the public service, reserving to himself the
faculty of acting according to circumstances in any political
contingency.' I forget the exact phraseology he used, but
what he conveyed was that Peel had made no positive resolution
never to enter into the public service again, and that
circumstances might occur to induce him to do so, but that
he neither desired nor expected anything of the kind, nor
would do anything to bring it about. At present he is
certainly acting a very creditable and a very useful part,
and one, if he persists in it, which will redound to his
honour, and greatly enhance his reputation. But it is
difficult to feel entire confidence in a man who is not really
high-minded. If he once begins to shuffle and intrigue, he
is lost. The best security for his good conduct is that it
is not only his best policy, but it is almost his only possible
policy. His influence and his power depend upon his great
abilities, and upon his judicious and honourable employment
of them; he has no party at his back, he has few political
and still fewer personal adherents, nor does he seem to
make any exertions to acquire either the one or the other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A BAD WEEK FOR GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 28th.</i>&mdash;The last week was a bad one for the Government.
One incident was ridiculous, one unfortunate. Strutt
came down to the House on Monday, made a speech of two
hours on his Railroad Bill, developing the whole plan, and
ended by withdrawing it: a mountain and a mouse. Great
was the surprise, and great the ridicule. The <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="hidden information">dessous des cartes</i>
was that Strutt had got up his speech with much labour, and
was only told just before the House met that Government
had resolved to withdraw the Bill. All this comes of having
an inefficient man and a bad measure; thence vacillation,
uncertainty, failure, and mortification. This was bad. Then
they suffered a defeat on the Poor Law. The clause for prohibiting
the separation of old people was carried against
them; it was a mistaken piece of humanity, for the old
people would be better off as the Bill was. All this shows
that it is high time the session should be brought to a
close.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 13th.</i>&mdash;The session is drawing to a close, but far
from satisfactorily for the Government, who have lost ground
in public estimation. Bill after bill has been thrown over,
and, after a great deal of time entirely wasted, the session
will end with hardly anything having been done. The last
two measures given up were the Health of Towns and the
Irish Estates Bills, and then the affair of the Wellington
Statue came to crown all, in which the Government were
bullied and tricked by Croker and Trench, who contrived to
enlist the passions or prejudices of the Duke in their cause,
made him their cat's-paw, and so accomplished their ends.
The vexatious opposition to the Health of Towns Bill by
George Bentinck, Hudson, and Co., made it very difficult to
carry it, but the truth is they were wrong to bring in such
measures so late in the session, and the measures were not
framed in a manner to get through with short discussions.
It is easy to say 'What could they do?' and 'They could
not help it,' but the public does not analyse but looks to results,
and therefore sees in the whole conduct of affairs proofs
of weakness, vacillation, and mismanagement. This discredits
the Government; they had before no popularity, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
were accepted as a necessity under circumstances rather
than as desirable. Ellesmere, who is very friendly to them,
tells me they have no credit or fame so far as his observation
goes in the country, and people say 'this can't go on,'
though without any fixed idea what is to be done. All this
is very deplorable. Then Lord John does not make up by
his personal qualities for his political mistakes or shortcomings;
he is not conciliatory, and sometimes gives grievous
offence. The other night in the House of Commons
he was so savage with Hume, without any cause, that he
enlisted all sympathies in Hume's favour, and was generally
blamed for his tone and manner. He is miserably wanting
in amenity, and in the small arts of acquiring popularity,
which are of such incalculable value to the leader of a party,
still more of a Government; then, while he has the reputation
of being obstinate, he is wanting in firmness. His conduct
about his own election has been very unwise, and has given
great offence; he has suffered himself to be persuaded to
stand for the City of London in conjunction with three other
Liberals, including Rothschild, and to make a great contest,
instead of coming quietly in by a compromise, which all
moderate men desired, and none more than Lord John himself.
He was so opposed to a contest, and especially to Rothschild's
standing (which is a great piece of impertinence, when he
knows he can't take his seat), that he threatened to resign
himself if they persisted in their scheme of bringing in all
four, and then he was over-persuaded to consent to the
contest. They offered to pay his expenses; this he refused,
and the Duke will have to pay them. In short, on the whole,
the Government is not in good odour: they don't inspire
confidence; they are neither popular nor respected, but they
are indispensable, and have the strength of circumstances.
If the country was polled, nineteen out of twenty would vote
for Peel's being minister; the Queen would be enchanted
to have him back; but Peel has no party, and can have none
unless circumstances and necessities make one for him. The
great Tory party is acephalous, or rather they are weak from
the utter incompetence of their leaders, so that matters are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
in that sort of lock which prevents any other combination
and any change, but which renders the present Government
very powerless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S VAGARIES.</div>

<p>The Cambridge installation went off with prodigious
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="luster">éclat</i>, and the Queen was enchanted at the enthusiastic
reception she met with; but the Duke of Wellington was
if possible received with even more enthusiasm. It is incredible
what popularity environs him in his latter days; he
is followed like a show wherever he goes, and the feeling of
the people <i>for him</i> seems to be the liveliest of all popular
sentiments; yet he does nothing to excite it, and hardly
appears to notice it. He is in wonderful vigour of body, but
strangely altered in mind, which is in a fitful uncertain
state, and there is no knowing in what mood he may be
found; everybody is afraid of him, nobody dares to say
anything to him; he is sometimes very amiable and good-humoured,
sometimes very irritable and morose. About this
affair of the Statue, Croker and Trench contrived to work
him up to a state of frenzy; he was as near as possible resigning
upon it. When Lord John wrote to him the other
day in consequence of what passed in the House of Commons,
he wrote a long rigmarole of an answer, which Lord John
did not read yesterday, but gave the substance of it. All
this is very unlike him. Then he is astonishing the world
by a strange intimacy he has struck up with Miss &mdash;&mdash;,
with whom he passes his life, and all sorts of reports
have been rife of his intention to marry her. Such are the
lamentable appearances of decay in his vigorous mind, which
are the more to be regretted because he is in most enviable
circumstances, without any political responsibility, yet
associated with public affairs, and surrounded with every
sort of respect and consideration on every side&mdash;at Court,
in Parliament, in society, and in the country.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 22nd.</i>&mdash;All last week at Croxteth for Liverpool races,
on Saturday to Worsley, passing four hours at Liverpool to
see sights; went to the docks, town hall, &amp;c.; and met Cardwell
canvassing. I was told there that Peel is very unpopular
in Liverpool on account of the heavy losses that have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
sustained this year by mercantile men, all of which they
attribute to his Currency Bill, consequently the Peelite Conservatives
are very few; but my informant added that nevertheless
everybody, even those who were most angry with him
on account of this Bill, would be glad to see him in office
again. I expressed surprise at this; he said they all thought
him the best workman, and found when they approached
him on business that he knew everything about the subjects
which interested them. Liverpool is increasing enormously
in trade, which is now greater than in London. Last week
appeared Peel's letter to the electors of Tamworth, and John
Russell's speech in the City. The latter was very good, and
the former not bad in its way; but Peel's case for himself,
however well put, is no answer to the accusations which
have been elaborated in the 'Quarterly Review' with all the
malignity and virulence of ungovernable hatred. There is
some truth in the article, which is, however, revolting from
its coarse and savage spirit. Arbuthnot told me yesterday
an anecdote about that article. It was a review of a pamphlet
called 'Pitt and Peel Policy.' Croker contrived to get
hold of a copy of the proof-sheets of it, and sent it to the
Duke of Wellington, pointing out a passage rather offensive
to him, and informing the Duke he meant to review it. The
Duke in sending it back advised Croker if he did review it
to do so in terms of decency and moderation, and asked to
see the review before it was printed. The passage about the
Duke was struck out in the process of correction, and Croker
had to alter his review in consequence; but he disregarded the
Duke's advice, and published the article without letting the
Duke see it. He gave as his reason for this that he wished
the Duke to be able to say that he had never read a word of it.
It seems that after some of his former attacks he tried to put
himself on his former footing of intimacy with Peel, and wrote
to him 'My dear Peel.' Peel would not hear of it, wrote to
him a dry, formal answer, and told him in so many words
that their intimacy was at an end. Croker was furious, and
has been overflowing with gall and bitterness ever since.<a href="#Footnote_22" id="FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, October 23rd, 1847.</i>&mdash;After many weeks, or
months, during which from idleness or unexplainable repugnance
I have never written a line, I at last resume my pen,
less for the purpose of writing the history of these past
weeks than to begin again to record what occurs to me.
Stirring weeks they have been, and full of interest of the
most lively and general description. In the midst of all the
agitation that has prevailed at home and abroad, intrigues
and quarrels and wars begun or threatened in various countries,
we have been absorbed by the great panic in the money
market, which is still at its height, and of which no man
ventures to predict, or thinks he can see, the termination.
There never was a subject on which such diversified opinions
prevail. Men are indeed pretty well agreed as to the cause
of the present distress, and in admitting that it is the result
of over-speculation, and of the Railway mania which fell
upon the country two years ago. But the great contest is as
to the share Peel's Bill of 1844 has had in aggravating and
keeping up the state of distress and difficulty in which trade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
and commerce are involved, and whether this Bill ought to
be presently relaxed by the authority of Government or not.
On these points the greatest disputes and varieties of opinion
exist. Charles Wood has, however, been stout and resolute
from the first, and quite determined not to consent to any
interference. There have been some different opinions, and
some shades of difference, some doubts, amongst the members
of the Cabinet, though I do not know the particulars of
them; but yesterday the Cabinet broke up, having terminated
their deliberations, and resolved <i>as matters now stand</i>
not to do anything. My own belief is that this will prove a
sound resolution, and that they would only have aggravated
the evil by interference. I shall not, however, write anything
more now on this subject. I have nothing secret or
curious or interesting to record, and the details of it will be
found in a hundred publications.</p>

<p>The most remarkable circumstance is the intense interest
and curiosity which are felt about Peel's opinions and intentions.
Everybody asks with anxiety what he says, what he
thinks, what he will do. His vanity may well be gratified
by the immense importance which is attached to his opinions
and to the course he may take and recommend; his power
seems to be as great out of office as it ever was in office;
nothing was ever so strange or anomalous as his position.
Half the commercial world attributes the distress and danger
to his Bill; he is liked by nobody. The Conservatives detest
him with unquenched hatred, and abuse him with unmitigated
virulence. The Whigs regard him with a mixture of
fear, suspicion, and dislike, but treat him with great deference
and respect. There is a party which is called by others
and by itself, but not (publicly at least) acknowledged by
him as his party; it is far from numerous, and too weak for
substantive power. He has never opened his lips on the
great questions of the day, and is an oracle shrouded in
mystery. It would seem as if a man thus abandoned by the
majority of his former political friends and adherents, without
personal attachments and following, an object of hatred to
one party and of suspicion to the other, the country at large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
or a great proportion of it attributing to his financial
measures the distress by which all are afflicted or endangered,
could by no possibility occupy any great and
important position in the country: nevertheless he does.
All eyes are turned upon him as if by a sort of fascination.
If the country could be polled to decide who should be
Minister, he would be elected by an immense majority.
There is a prevalent opinion that he <i>must</i> return to power;
nobody knows when or how, but the notion is that the
present men are weak, that the public necessities and perils
are great, and if a crisis of difficulty and danger should
arrive, that Peel is the only man capable of extricating the
country from it. The consequence of all this is that his
<i>prestige</i> and his influence are enormous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BANK CHARTER ACT SUSPENDED.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Newmarket, November 1st.</i>&mdash;I came here last Saturday
week. On Friday I believed it to have been <i>settled</i> that
nothing should be done by the Government to relieve the
panic. On that day, however, George Glyn and other
bankers had had an interview with John Russell, and they
came from it with a persuasion that he would do something.<a href="#Footnote_23" id="FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
The same evening Peel came to town on his way to Windsor.
Charles Wood went to him, laid before him the state of
affairs, telling him all the accounts they had received from
the country, all the pressure they were undergoing, and
explained their views and intentions. On the next day,
Saturday, still more urgent demands were made, and still
more alarming representations arrived. On Sunday, a
Cabinet (or half Cabinet) was held, and there it was resolved
to grant the relief that has been seen. The Duke of Bedford
was bidden to Windsor to meet Peel, who went there on
Saturday. At dinner on Sunday the Queen received Lord
John's box with the result of the deliberations of the
Cabinet, which he requested Her Majesty to communicate
to Peel. The next day the Duke of Bedford had a long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
conversation with Peel, very amicable and very satisfactory.
He spoke in high terms of Lord John Russell and commended
the Government, expressed his acquiescence under
the peculiar circumstances of the case in the resolution they
had come to, and declared his intention to support them.
He appears to have talked very openly, and in a very friendly
and even generous spirit. The Duke happened to have
with him a letter which Lord John had written to him at
the time of Peel's bill passing through Parliament, in which
he had expressed his approval of the general principle, but
found fault with some of the details. This letter the Duke
showed to Peel, who was exceedingly pleased, and told him
his brother was quite right, and that his bill had been
faulty in the details which he had remarked upon.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, November 8th.</i>&mdash;The Archbishop of York is
dead.<a href="#Footnote_24" id="FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
He was in no way remarkable except for the wonderful
felicity of his whole life from first to last. It would
perhaps be difficult to find a greater example of uninterrupted
prosperity. He was not a man of great capacity nor
of profound learning, but he had peculiarly the <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="healthy mind in a healthy body">mens sana in
corpore sano</i>. He was nobly born and highly allied. He
enjoyed robust health, had a vigorous frame with a sound
understanding, and he was cheerfully obliging, good-tempered,
and sociable; his profession, his tastes, pursuits, and
the quality of his mind cast him into the best and choicest
society, where he played his part not brilliantly but with an
amiable and graceful prosperity. He had many friends and
no enemies, was universally esteemed and respected, and
beloved by his own family. He was the most prosperous
of men, full of professional dignities and emoluments, and
the inheritor of a large private fortune; he was the father
of a numerous family, whom he saw flourishing around him
in opulence and worldly success; he lived in the exercise of
a magnificent hospitality, and surrounded with social enjoyments.
No misfortunes or sorrows disturbed the placid
current of his life, and his mental and bodily faculties continued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
unimpaired to the last; his illness, which lasted only
a few hours, was without pain, and no more than the natural
exhaustion of ninety-one accomplished years. Such a life
and such a death so irreproachable and fortunate may well
excite envy and admiration. He and Mr. Grenville so conjoined
in life died at the same age, each having reached his
ninety-first year, and within eleven months of each other&mdash;men
in their different ways equally prosperous, virtuous,
and happy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRITICAL STATE OF IRELAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>November 21st.</i>&mdash;Parliament met on Thursday. There
are very queer-looking people among the new members, particularly
Mr. Fox.<a href="#Footnote_25" id="FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
I was introduced to him many years ago,
when I went to Finsbury Square to hear him preach; he was
a very fine preacher, but I never have seen him since.</p>

<p>The state of Ireland is awful. I have written to
Clarendon repeatedly, urging him to ask for great powers.
He was reluctant, and wanted to try the force of the law
as it is, and the Cabinet were not disposed to adopt strong
coercive measures; but the public voice loudly demands
coercion and repression, and Lord Lansdowne told me yesterday
he was resolved to act in accordance with the general
feeling. Parliament never met in more difficult and disturbed
times: complete disorganisation, famine and ruin in Ireland,
financial difficulty, general alarm and insecurity here, want
of capital, want of employment. It requires all one's faith
in the general soundness and inherent strength of 'the
thing' (as Cobbett called it) to silence one's apprehensions.
Then Colonial distress is impending, by which I am likely
to be personally affected to the extent perhaps of half what
I possess. I thank God that I regard this contingency
with the utmost tranquillity or insensibility. I should not
like it, but if the necessity arises I hope and believe I can
make the necessary sacrifices and changes in my habits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
without repining outwardly or inwardly. I have not heard
or known much lately that is worth recording, and I am in
one of my fits of disinclination to write.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LETTER FROM LORD CLARENDON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>December 1st.</i>&mdash;I went to the House of Lords the night
Parliament opened, and heard Stanley's speech. It lasted
above two hours, was a declaration of war, very slashing and
flashing, and drew forth vehement cheers from the Lords
behind him. It was a regular Stanleyan speech, just like
himself, and exhibits all his unfitness for the great functions
of government and legislation: not but what there was much
truth in a great deal he said, especially about Ireland. The
next day George Bentinck bellowed and gesticulated for two
hours in the House of Commons with the same violence
but without the same eloquence as Stanley. Everybody
looked with impatience for the Irish measures, and everybody
expected (most people earnestly desiring) that they
should be as strong as they could be made. In the House
of Lords I had seen the Duke of Bedford for a moment,
who told me they were the result of a compromise between
Clarendon and the Government, the latter refusing to give
all he had required, and the former having resolved not to
stay with less than he eventually obtained. The night
before last Sir George Grey introduced the Government
measures, which appeared to almost everybody insufficient
for the object. Peel however supported them in a very
dexterous speech. He said he felt bound to support the
Government in whatever they thought fit to propose, and
that it was not for Parliament to force upon them greater
powers than they in their discretion required; but he hinted
his apprehensions lest some of the provisions of the Bill,
or rather its deficiencies, would be found obstructions of the
objects in view. The Irish were evidently surprised and had
expected more stringent measures, and in truth it would
have been just as easy to carry a really efficient measure
as this, which will probably prove abortive. This morning
I have a letter from Clarendon, who tells me what took
place between himself and the Cabinet on the subject. He
says, 'I expect the Bill will prove unsatisfactory to all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
parties...nevertheless I hope it will answer not so much
by its own provisions as by the evidence it will afford that
Parliament and the Government are in earnest....
In the present temper of England fancy what a figure the
Government would have cut if they had opened Parliament
without any repressive measure and announced that the
ordinary law would prove sufficient, and that <i>to it</i> things
were left! they would have been looked on as little better
than accessories or instigators, and at all events I have
the satisfaction of having saved them from this very
serious scrape, which really would have caused an immediate
increase of murder here. No one could be more
desirous than myself to avoid Coercion Bills, or indeed to
ask for any increased powers; but when I found that the
ordinary law was insufficient to protect life and property,
I sent over the heads of two Bills, both of which I meant
should be permanent&mdash;one for punishing districts in which
crimes were committed; the other for registering arms,
&amp;c.&mdash;a sort of police regulation proper for any country and
especially required for Ireland. <i>These Bills were ignored
by the Cabinet</i>, for which various utterly inexplicable
reasons were given, and Lord John Russell said he hoped
at least to get through the winter without any extraordinary
measures. I then wrote both to Lord Lansdowne
and John Russell to say that though I did not wish to
cause them any embarrassment, and would get on here as
well as I could for as long as I could, yet that nothing
should induce me to remain an hour after I thought my
power of usefulness was gone, as I was sure it would be
unless my hands were strengthened. This produced an
immediate change, and the only question then was what
would be the best form of repression. A good deal of
time was lost on this, and Sir George Grey at length proposed
as a model one of the Six Acts (1819). I did not
like it very much, but I had no wish obstinately to adhere
to my own Bills, which perhaps might not have been
stringent enough, as they were proposed before things had
got so bad and the spirit of combination was so manifest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and they were moreover intended to be permanent. So,
after amending the Bill a little with the law officers here,
I consented to it, and hope it will not be a failure when
put into operation.' So that if Lord John and his Cabinet
had been left to themselves they would have done nothing,
and have let the Irish murderers do their worst with no
other hindrance than the ordinary course of law! Clarendon
saved the Government by insisting; for if they had met
Parliament and proposed nothing, they would have been
swept away in a whirlwind of indignation. Addresses
would have been proposed in both Houses and carried by
immense majorities, and the Government would have been
at an end.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 7th.</i>&mdash;The Irish measures were introduced, and
everybody was surprised they were not stronger. Peel supported
the Government, and there was hardly any opposition.
The Government people tell everybody that Clarendon
is satisfied with the measures, thinks they will prove effective,
and his name and authority silence objections. The
day after Grey's speech I met Peel in the Park. He was in
high force and good humour, and looking very fresh and
well. After talking of some other things, I said, 'You supported
the Government very handsomely in their Irish
measure.' He replied, 'Yes, and I mean to support them;
but they have made a great mistake and missed a great
opportunity; Parliament and the country would have confided
to the Lord Lieutenant any powers the Government
chose to ask for; they have totally misunderstood the state
of Ireland and the feeling and opinion of this country.'
In short, he entirely agreed with me that they ought to
have asked for much stronger coercive power. There are
people nevertheless who think it of greater importance to
pass a measure quickly, and with nearly general concurrence,
and therefore that this is better than one more
vigorous, but which would be more strenuously opposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>On Friday last Peel made a great speech on Wood's
statement <i>in re</i> the Bank Charter. It was very able, and
the Government were delighted because he supported them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
so cordially; the Opposition cut a very miserable figure and
showed how wavering and uncertain they are, without plan,
object, or tactics. They divided on a question of adjournment,
and sent their weakness forth to the country, but did
not move an amendment on which they might have united
all their force and caught many stray votes. I saw Graham
two days ago; he was chuckling over their mismanagement,
said that if they had moved that it should be an instruction
to the Committee to report at once on the Bill of 1844,
they would have put the Government into difficulties and
might have divided a large number; but he sees how disorganised
and inefficient they are. He talked about a
great many things in an amicable strain towards the
Government, and a great deal on the defences of the
country, about which the Duke of Wellington is in such
a perturbed state of mind.</p>

<p>The Duke wrote a very long and able letter to Sir John
Burgoyne some time ago on this subject; this letter Lady
Burgoyne and her daughters copied and distributed among
their friends. Pigou, a meddling zealot, who does nothing
but read Blue Books and write letters to the 'Times' and
'Chronicle,' contrived to get hold of a copy, and fired off a
letter to the 'Morning Chronicle,' with a part of its contents.
The Duke was not pleased at this, and Lord John
Russell was very angry; it has made a noise in the world.
The Duke always accuses his old colleagues of doing nothing
about the defences, and turning a deaf ear to his remonstrances.
Graham says this is not true, and he showed me
a very elaborate paper he had drawn up for the Cabinet,
with various recommendations, which he left with Sir George
Grey when he left the Home Office, and the copy of a Bill
for calling out the militia, which was also left with Fox
Maule. He talked about Ireland, and said that the Master
of the Rolls (Smith) had drawn up a Bill for the sale of
entailed estates, which he recommended Clarendon to look
at. He told me that Peel thought this an excellent Parliament,
promising to be practical and business-like, serious
listeners and men intent on not letting the time of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
House be wasted as it has lately been by eternal talkers,
and continual early adjournments. Everybody was alarmed
at the aspect of this Parliament at first, even the Speaker,
who thought it would be unmanageable. I laughed at their
fears from the first, and now everybody says it is an excellent
Parliament.</p>

<p>A few days ago I met Dr. Wiseman, and had much talk
with him about Rome and the Pope's recent rescript about
the colleges in Ireland. He said it was all owing to there
being no English Ambassador at Rome, and no representative
of the moderate Irish clergy; Irish ecclesiastical affairs
were managed by Machale through Franzoni, head of the
Propaganda, and Father Ventura, who has the Pope's ear,
and he strongly advised that Murray and his party should
send an agent to Rome, and that Lord Minto<a href="#Footnote_26" id="FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> should communicate
with Father Ventura, who is an able and a good
man, deeply interested in Irish affairs, and anxious for
British connexion. He talked a great deal about the Pope,
who, he said, had not time to enquire into these matters
himself, and took his inspirations from the above-named
personages; that he is of unbending firmness in all that
relates to religion, but liberal and anxious to conciliate
England. He thinks the rescript may be early got rid of
by a little management, and he mentioned an instance of
the Pope's good sense and fairness in a matter relating to a
Scotch educational establishment in which a Dr. Gillies was
concerned. I am going to speak to Lord John Russell
about these things, and to try and persuade him to send
Normanby as Ambassador to Rome; he is ready to go, and
it would be a very good appointment, besides the great
advantage of getting him away from Paris, where he is very
uncomfortable, and feels the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="discomfort">gêne</i> and mortification of his
position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. HAMPDEN, BISHOP OF HEREFORD.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>December 15th.</i>&mdash;I called on Lord John Russell three
days ago and told him what Wiseman had said, and also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
about Normanby and Rome. He said he had ordered a Bill
to be drawn up to legalise our intercourse with the Pope.
I told him also what Graham desired me to do. He said
he had read his paper at the time, but made no further
remarks on Graham's communication. Last night in the
House of Lords Stanley made a speech about Minto and
his mission, when Lord Lansdowne made a very good reply
and spoke out about our diplomatic relations with the Pope.</p>

<p>The Chancellor is very ill and not likely ever to sit again
on the Woolsack. Great speculation, of course, about his
successor (which people fancy will be Campbell or Rolfe),
and Brougham is evidently not without hopes of clutching
the Great Seal himself. He has been attending assiduously
at the Judicial Committee and behaving marvellously well,
so attentive, patient, and laborious, everybody is astonished;
but the Duke of Bedford writes me word he has had letters
from him expressing the utmost anxiety to see him and talk
to him <i>on a matter of great importance which he can speak of to
nobody else</i>, not even to Lord John or to Lord Lansdowne,
and signing himself, 'Your's most affectionately, H. B.'!
This is very amusing.</p>

<p>Hampden's bishopric has made a great stir after all:<a href="#Footnote_27" id="FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
thirteen protesting bishops, a stout answer from Lord John,
a long, very clever rejoinder from the Bishop of Exeter, and
a sensible protest the other way from Bishop Stanley. There
never was a greater piece of folly than Lord John's bringing
this hornet's nest about his ears, nothing could be less worth
while. It is not over yet, and there will be more kicking
and clamouring; but Lord John, however foolish he was
in making the appointment, must of course go through
with it now, and then like everything else it will be soon
forgotten.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 22nd.</i>&mdash;On Sunday to the Temple Church;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
divine music and a very good preacher&mdash;a Mr. Hawes.
Monday night I dined with Milman and went to the Westminster
Play; pretty well done. The Hampden controversy
flares away. Hampden himself has written a long, querulous,
ill-composed letter to Lord John Russell, which he had
better have let alone; if he did write, he should have
written a shorter, more pithy and more dignified letter.
Every day makes the fault of having appointed him more
apparent.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 24th.</i>&mdash;Lord John Russell wrote an answer to
the Bishop of Exeter, correcting a mistake in the Bishop's
letter, and assuring him of his persuasion that he had conscientiously
fulfilled his duty in writing, and his respect for
his talents and his position in the Church. This brought a
rejoinder which is a curiosity, written in a state of delight
at the politeness of Lord John, and abounding in suavities
of the most juicy description. Lord John persists that he
has done a very wise thing, and predicts that before long
everybody will admit it, and this opinion is grounded on
the knowledge he has of the dangerous progress of Tractarianism,
which this appointment is calculated to arrest.</p>

<p>I went yesterday to St. George's Hospital to see the
chloroform tried. A boy two years and a half old was cut
for a stone. He was put to sleep in a minute; the stone
was so large and the bladder so contracted, the operator
could not get hold of it, and the operation lasted above
twenty minutes, with repeated probings by different instruments;
the chloroform was applied from time to time, and
the child never exhibited the slightest sign of consciousness,
and it was exactly the same as operating on a dead body.
A curious example was shown of what is called the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étiquette</i>
of the profession. The operator (whose name I forget) could
not extract the stone, so at last he handed the instrument
to Keate, who is the finest operator possible, and he got
hold of the stone. When he announced that he had done
so, the first man begged to have the forceps back that he
might draw it out, and it was transferred to him; but in
taking it he let go the stone, and the whole thing had to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
done over again. It was accomplished, but not of course
without increasing the local inflammation, and endangering
the life of the child. I asked Keate why, when he had got
hold of the stone, he did not draw it out. He said the other
man's 'dignity' would have been hurt if he had not been
allowed to complete what he had begun! I have no words
to express my admiration for this invention, which is the
greatest blessing ever bestowed on mankind, and the inventor
of it the greatest of benefactors, whose memory
ought to be venerated by countless millions for ages yet to
come. All the great discoveries of science sink into insignificance
when compared with this. It is a great privilege
to have lived in the times which saw the production of steam,
of electricity, and now of ether&mdash;that is, of the development
and application of them to human purposes, to the multiplication
of enjoyments and the mitigation of pain. But
wonderful as are the powers and the feats of the steam-engine
and the electric telegraph, the chloroform far transcends
them all in its beneficent and consolatory operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OPERATION UNDER CHLOROFORM.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>December 26th.</i>&mdash;Lamartine's 'Histoire des Girondins' is
the most successful book that has been published for many
years. He is the Jenny Lind of literature; his book is on
every table and in every mouth; it just suits the half-informed
and the idle, whom it dazzles, amuses, and interests; but
his apparent partiality shocks the humanity of the age; and
the generality of readers are unable to comprehend his
philosophical analysis, and psychological theories of Robespierre's
character. One of his most striking anecdotes is
the conversation he gives between Louis Philippe and Danton,
in which, according to Lamartine, Danton predicts to
the young Duc de Chartres that he will one day be King,
and tells him when that happens to remember the prophecy
of Danton. I last night asked the Duc de Broglie<a href="#Footnote_28" id="FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
if that anecdote is true. He said it was not true: the King indeed
had had a conversation with Danton, when the latter said to
him, 'Young man, what do you do here? Your place is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
with the army.' So much of it is true, but the rest&mdash;the
essential part, the prediction&mdash;is all false. The Duke told
me he had read the King's own account of the conversation
in his own journal, where it is recorded as he described.
He said the King had kept a copious journal from a very
early period. He afterwards talked a great deal about him,
of his great industry and activity, of the quantity he read
and wrote, and that he read and commented upon all the
documents submitted to him for his signature. I regret
not having made more acquaintance than I have done here
with the Duke de Broglie, and Jarnac gives me to understand
that he had rather expected me to cultivate him
more than I have, and was disposed to receive my advances.
The chief reason for my not doing so was that I found the
greatest difficulty in understanding what he says.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 1st, 1848.</i>&mdash;The Hampden affair is still <i>boring</i> on
with prejudicial effects to everybody concerned in it. Dean
Merewether, who is piqued and provoked at not having got
the bishopric himself (which William IV. once promised
him), wrote a foolish, frothy letter to Lord John Russell,
who sent an equally foolish, because petulant, reply&mdash;only
in two lines. The Bishop of Oxford has recanted, and he
of Salisbury has apologised for their respective parts; the
former in a very ridiculous letter, not calculated to do him
any credit. Everybody will believe that he found his conduct
unpalatable at Court, so took a pretext for shuffling
out of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD HARROWBY.</div>

<p>Last week, after a few days' illness, without pain or
trouble, Lord Harrowby died at Sandon, having just completed
his eighty-fifth year.<a href="#Footnote_29" id="FNanchor_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
The three old friends, Tom Grenville,
the Archbishop of York, and Lord Harrowby, thus died
all three of old age, peacefully and painlessly, within twelve
months. Lord Harrowby survived Mr. Grenville exactly a
year, and the Archbishop three months. He was the last of
his generation and of the colleagues of Mr. Pitt, the sole
survivor of those stirring times and mighty contests. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
had all along such bad health that half a century ago his
life was considered a very bad one, and yet he reached his
eighty-sixth year with his faculties very little impaired. He
was at the top of the second-rate men, always honourable
and straightforward, generally liberal and enlightened, greatly
esteemed and respected. No man ever passed through a long
political life more entirely without blemish or suspicion. It
is curious that in the biographical notices of him, which
according to the custom of the present day have appeared in
the newspapers, no mention, or hardly any, has been made of
by far the most remarkable transaction in which he ever was
engaged, that of procuring the passing of the second reading
of the second Reform Bill in the House of Lords&mdash;one of the
most important services, as it turned out, that any man ever
rendered to his country. In conjunction with Lord Wharncliffe
he accomplished this, his conduct being perfectly disinterested,
for he had long before resolved never again to
take office, and had refused to be Prime Minister on the
death of Canning. I was in their confidence, and much concerned
in the whole of that transaction, as fully appears in
my Journal of that period. His speech on the first Reform
Bill was very celebrated, exceedingly able, and superior to
any other he ever made. He was remarkably well informed.
Madame de Staël speaks of him somewhere as Lord Harrowby,
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="who knows our literature better than we do">qui connaît notre littérature un peu mieux que nous-mêmes</span>;'
but his precise manner and tart disposition prevented
his being agreeable in society. He was very religious,
very generous, and a man of the strictest integrity in private
and in public life. I lived a great deal with him, but
all my intimacy was with his admirable wife, whose virtues
and merits I have elsewhere recorded.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Bowood, January 7th.</i>&mdash;I came here on Tuesday to meet
the Duke of Bedford, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord
Devon, Lord Auckland, &amp;c. Wood talked to me about his
scheme of taxation; he has been in great doubt how he
should apportion and increase (as he must) the income-tax,
whether <i>income</i> or <i>property</i>. After much consideration he
appears to have nearly made up his mind to impose three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
per cent. on Ireland, and to raise it in England to five,
or perhaps something less; to announce that the increase
is to be temporary, but the three per cent. to be permanent;
and then, on the strength of the extension to Ireland, to
propose a grant to that country, without which Clarendon
cannot get on. Peel will concur in this plan.</p>

<p>Great talk here of George Bentinck's resignation of the
leadership of the Opposition. John Russell and his colleagues
are very sorry for it; nobody can think of a successor
to him, and, bad as he is, he seems the best man they
have. It seems they detest Disraeli, the only man of talent,
and in fact they have nobody; so much so, that Wood
thinks they will be obliged to go back to George Bentinck:
a very strange state of things! George Bentinck and Stanley
disagree on many points, especially on taxation; nevertheless
this party, thus acephalous and feeble, have really been
fancying they could come into office, and their notion is
that if the dissolution had been delayed they would have
had a majority, and would have come in. The Duke of
Beaufort told Bessborough so very seriously, and Lady
Jersey told me the same thing, and that George Bentinck
had promised her son Francis a place at the India Board!
These things are hardly credible, but they are nevertheless
true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HAMPDEN CONTROVERSY.</div>

<p>The Hampden war has been turning greatly to the
advantage of the Doctor; his enemies have exposed themselves
in the most flagrant manner, and Archdeacon Hare
has written a very able pamphlet also exposing the rascality
(for that is the proper word) of his accusers, and affording
his own valuable testimony to Hampden's orthodoxy; above
all things, Sly Sam of Oxford (my would-be director and
confessor) has covered himself with ridicule and disgrace.
The disgrace is the greater because everybody sees through
his motives: he has got into a scrape at Court and is trying
to scramble out of it; there, however, he is found out, and
his favour seems to have long been waning. The Duke of
Bedford tells me the Queen and Prince are in a state of hot
zeal in this matter. The Prince writes to Lord John every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
day, and urges him to prosecute Dean Merewether, which
of course Lord John is too wise to do. That Dean is a
very paltry fellow, and has moved heaven and earth to get
made a bishop himself; besides memorialising the Queen, he
wrote to Lord Lansdowne and suggested to him to put an
end to the controversy by making him a bishop now, and
Hampden at the next vacancy. The whole proceeding reflects
great discredit on the great mass of clergymen who
have joined in the clamour against Hampden, and on the
Oxonian majority who condemned him, for it is now pretty
clear that very few, if any, of them had ever read his
writings. Now that they are set forth, and people see his
unintelligible jargon about dogmas themselves unintelligible,
there must be some dispassionate men who will be disgusted
and provoked with the whole thing, and at the ferocity with
which these holy disputants assault and vituperate each
other about that which none of them understand, and which
it is a mere mockery and delusion to say that any of them
really believe; it is cant, hypocrisy, and fanaticism from
beginning to end. There is that old fawning sinner, the
Bishop of Exeter; it appears that a dozen years ago he
called on Hampden at Oxford to express to him the pleasure
with which he had read his Bampton Lectures, and to compliment
him on them. The Archbishop of Dublin was
present on this occasion.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 12th.</i>&mdash;From Bowood to Middleton on Saturday,
to town on Monday 10th. The morning I left Bowood,
Senior showed me the correspondence (not published) between
the Bishop of Oxford and Hampden. It is creditable
to the latter; the former really very despicable. The Bishop
put a parcel of questions to him as to his belief on points of
faith and doctrine, some of which were the most ordinary
matter of belief, others unintelligible. Hampden said he
might have regarded such questions on the most elementary
points of doctrine as an insult, but he would accept his
assurances that they were put in a friendly spirit (though
he must say much of his conduct was at variance with such
professions) and would therefore say 'Yes' to all of them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
To his last letter announcing his having withdrawn the
charges and read his works, Hampden merely sent a dry
acknowledgement of having received the letter.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 17th.</i>&mdash;Still this Hampden affair. Kelly got a
rule in Queen's Bench, and it will be argued in a few days.
Tractarians hope from the known Puseyism of Coleridge
and Patteson that the rule may be made absolute; but the
lawyers don't expect it and think a <i>strong</i> Court would
not have given a rule. However, it shows the anomaly
(not to say worse) of the whole ecclesiastical proceeding
under the Act of Henry VIII. The High Churchmen,
who want a separation of State from Church, though it
does not seem clear what it is they contemplate, are all on
the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="alert">qui vive</i>, and fancy their projects are put in a fair
train by all these proceedings; but though some of my
friends think very seriously of these crotchets, I believe they
are very despicable and harmless. This morning I got a
letter from the Duke of Bedford enclosing one from William
Cowper to him, informing him what took place when Hampden
was made Regius Professor. William Cowper had given
me some account of it at the time, which I inserted in my
journal, and I copied it out for the Duke of Bedford during
our discussion. I don't find that this more detailed account
varies much from the other, though it contains several more
particulars, and one relating to the Archbishop's nominees
curious enough. His account of the transaction is this,
saying he got it from Lord Melbourne, and by reference to
letters which passed at the time: 'The Archbishop of Canterbury
came to Lord Melbourne to announce the death
of Dr. Burton. In the conversation that ensued my uncle
requested the Archbishop to send him the names of the
persons that occurred to him as best qualified for the situation,
and begged him not to confine the list to a small
number. The Archbishop sent a list including Pusey,
Newman, and Keble; and if it was, as I believe, the list of
the Archbishop which is now before me, it contained the
names; but it is possible he may have sent only six, and
that the other three were added from another quarter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Lord Melbourne sent the nine names to the Archbishop
of Dublin (Whately) without mentioning who had recommended
them, and he justified the confidence reposed
in him by giving a full and impartial statement of what
he conceived to be the qualifications of each. But previous
to this he had been consulted by Lord Melbourne, and
asked whom he would recommend, and had written, on
22nd January, 1836, a long letter in which he said: "The
best fitted for a theological professorship that I have
any knowledge of are Dr. Hampden and Dr. Hinds,
afterwards Principal of Alban Hall; the qualifications I
allude to, and which they both possess in a higher degree
than any others I could name, are, first, sound learning;
secondly, vigour of mind to wield that learning, without
which the other is undigested food; and thirdly, the moral
and intellectual character adapted for conveying instruction.
Both Hinds and Hampden are what are considered
of liberal sentiments, but agree with me in keeping aloof
from parties political and ecclesiastical."... Lord
Melbourne doubted for some time between Arnold and
Hampden, but, thinking the former rather too rash and
unsettled in his opinions for so responsible a post, decided
in favour of the latter; and it was not till after he had
made up his mind that Hampden was the fittest person that
he asked Dr. Copleston to give him his opinion of him,
which opinion was so favourable that it confirmed him in
his choice; he did not send any list to Copleston. You
may rely on the accuracy of this statement as far as it
goes.' The Duke also told me in his letter that there had
been a very curious correspondence between Prince Albert
and the Bishop of Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HAMPDEN CASE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 18th.</i>&mdash;I have this morning received a copy of
the Archbishop of Canterbury's letter to Lord John about
making Hampden Bishop of Manchester. Lord John wrote
to him for his opinion, and here is his reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My dear Lord,&mdash;During the ten years which have passed since
Dr. Hampden was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford,
I have no reason to believe that he has taught from the Chair any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
doctrines at variance with the Articles of our Church; and in justice
to him I must say that I have discovered nothing objectionable in
the few publications of his which I have seen and which are ably
written; of his discretion or talents for business I have no means of
judging. These qualifications may be more than ordinarily required
in the first Bishop of such a place as Manchester. I have the honour
to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">W. Cantuar.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>This is his letter, which certainly warranted Lord John
in saying 'he received no discouragement from the Archbishop
of Canterbury.' It amounts very nearly to a sanction
of the appointment; and nothing but the Archbishop's
age, and the timidity, both natural to him and belonging
to his age, can excuse his not having taken a more active
part in allaying the irritation than he has done. So far as
the Archbishop was concerned, Lord John understated his
case.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 21st.</i>&mdash;Dined on Wednesday with Baron Rolfe&mdash;Campbell,
Langdale, Wilde, and Solicitor-General (Dundas);
much talk about the rule in Queen's Bench (in Hampden's
case), and whether the law must be altered. Campbell
against alteration, the rest thinking there must be some,
and the old law of Edward VI. making the bishoprics
donative restored. This is what Lushington told me must
be done.<a href="#Footnote_30" id="FNanchor_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN OF SPAIN.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 22nd.</i>&mdash;Aston<a href="#Footnote_31" id="FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
called on me yesterday, and told
me a great deal about Spain and Spanish affairs. He thinks
it is the object of Queen Christina to destroy the Queen,
her daughter, and that she will accomplish it; that she has
always hated her, and prefers (without caring much for her)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the Infanta; he thinks that by medical treatment the cutaneous
disease with which the Queen has been always afflicted
has been thrown in, and hence the epileptic fits by which she
has been recently attacked; he says that they have lately
put about her a French doctor, since which all her Spanish
physicians have declined to attend her. I own I cannot
believe anything so horrible as this implies, but it accords
with suspicions from other quarters. He told me that
Espartero before he left England showed him a letter he had
received from the Queen's music-master, a devoted adherent
of his who had continued to correspond with him. This
man was an eye-witness of the scene which took place when
the Queen was forced by Serrano to take Narvaez for her
Minister, having been by accident in the adjoining apartment.
The details are revolting, and show, if true, that the
Queen is nearly under duresse and incapable of any freedom
of action. She has, however, one chance of emancipation,
and that is in the attachment to her of the people of
Madrid, which is general and enthusiastic. She has all the
Manolas to a woman, and through them their lovers, brothers,
and friends; they would rise <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="en mass">en masse</i> for her if called upon.
Christina is universally unpopular and yet remains there;
she is gorged with riches and in possession of uncontrolled
power. When she left Spain in 1843 she stripped the palace
of all the plate and all the crown jewels of enormous value;
of all the gold and silver services there were not six spoons
left. Espartero appointed a committee to enquire into the
disappearance of the crown jewels, but they begged leave
not to report to avoid the scandalous exposure of the Queen's
mother, and she was left in possession of her spoil. The
young Queen was found without clothes to her back; the
Marchioness of Santa Cruz told Aston she had only six pairs
of darned cotton stockings which hurt her legs, then sore
with her cutaneous disease. Aston said that Bulwer was
constantly intriguing, foiled, found out, and not trusted by
any party or any individual.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Brocket, January 22nd.</i>&mdash;I came here this afternoon,
Melbourne having at last invited me. I have been intimately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
acquainted with him for thirty-five years, and he
never before (but once to dinner) asked me into his house.
He expects people to come, and at dinner to-day he proclaimed
his social ideas and wishes. 'I wish,' he said, 'my
friends to come to me whenever they please, and I am mortified
when they don't come.' I told him he ought to send
out circulars to that effect. He is well and in good spirits,
and ready to talk by fits and starts, very anti-Peel and anti-Free-trade,
rattled away against men and things, especially
against several of his old friends in particular. As usual, he
put forth some queer sayings, such as that 'Nobody ever did
anything very foolish except from some strong principle,' he
had remarked that. He said very little about the Hampden
quarrel, only that he 'thought Lord John might have avoided
it.' He said he had wished to make Arnold a bishop,
but somebody told him if he did he thought the Archbishop
would very likely refuse to consecrate him; so he
gave up the idea without finding out what the Archbishop
thought of it. Beauvale was very strong against Palmerston
and delighted with the articles in the 'Times' attacking his
administration and his letter to the Greek Government; he
thought it very lucky he had not gone to Paris, where he
must have quarrelled with Palmerston for not obeying his
absurd instructions, and said <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="he had been there">qu'il avait passé par là</i> at
Vienna. When he was there, Lady Westmorland told him
she had been commissioned to give him a hint that he
would not be able to remain there and oppose Palmerston
as he often did. He asked her who told her this; she said
<i>Melbourne</i>! This was the way the Prime Minister tried to
prevent a rupture between his brother and his brother-in-law,
not daring to face Palmerston, though disapproving of his
policy and his ways. Well might Beauvale say Palmerston
would always have his way, for he was bold, resolute, and unscrupulous;
he would not yield to others, and would make all
others yield to him; and he is unchecked by public opinion
here, nobody knowing or caring anything about foreign
affairs. Lady Beauvale told me some anecdotes of the Royal
children, which may some day have an interest when time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
has tested and developed their characters. The Princess
Royal is very clever, strong in body and in mind; the Prince
of Wales weaker and more timid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CORRECTED DESPATCH.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;Came back from Brocket on Monday.
Melbourne not much inclined to talk; he dines at a quarter-past
seven, and he went to bed, or at least to his room, at
half-past eight. He is as anti-Palmerstonian as his brother,
agreed with me that Palmerston had all along greatly exaggerated
the importance of the Spanish marriage. Much
talk with Beauvale, particularly about Palmerston; he told
me an anecdote of him which shows the man and how difficult
he is to manage. During the Spanish discussions
Beauvale was at Windsor, and one day when the Prince was
in his room the draft of a despatch from Palmerston arrived
to Lord John Russell, which he wanted to show to the
Prince, and afterwards to submit to the Queen for her sanction.
Finding the Prince was in Beauvale's room, he came
there and read out the despatch. There was a paragraph in
it saying the succession of the Duchesse de Montpensier's
children would be inadmissible by the constitutional law of
Spain (or words to this effect). Lord John said he thought
this ought to be expunged; that we might say what we
pleased as to the effect of treaties, but it did not become <i>us</i>
to lay down the constitutional law of Spain; the Prince and
Beauvale both concurred, and Lord John said he would
strike out this passage, and submit it so amended to the
Queen. He did so, and Her Majesty took the same view.
It was returned so altered to Palmerston; but when the
despatch was published, it was found that Palmerston had
re-inserted the paragraph, and so it stood. What more may
have passed I know not, but it is clear that they all <i>stood</i> it,
as they always will.</p>

<p>Lady Beauvale gave me an account of the scene at dinner
at Windsor when Melbourne broke out against Peel (about
the Corn Laws). She was sitting next Melbourne, who
was between her and the Queen; he said pretty much what
I have somewhere else stated, and he would go on though it
was evidently disagreeable to the Queen, and embarrassing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
to everybody else. At last the Queen said to him, 'Lord
Melbourne, I must beg you not to say anything more
on this subject now; I shall be very glad to discuss it
with you at any other time,' and then he held his tongue.
It is however an amiable trait in her, that while she is
austere to almost everybody else, she has never varied in
her attachment to him, and to him everything has always
been permitted; he might say and do what he liked.
Now she constantly writes to him, never forgets his birthday.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General<a href="#Footnote_32" id="FNanchor_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
has got into a scrape about his
son's election, but it remains to be seen if he will not get
out of it; there was a petition against young Jervis, and
they gave the petitioners 1,500<i>l.</i> to drop it. The bargain
was discovered, and other parties presented a petition just in
time. Dundas would be thrown into a great embarrassment
by anything that removed the Attorney-General; he <i>could</i>
not succeed; the Government would not have him, nor
would he undertake it; he has no briefs, a thing unheard
of for a Solicitor-General, and the Government found him
so useless that they ceased to consult him, and desirous of
getting somebody more efficient, they proposed to him to be
Judge-Advocate, which however he refused: he hardly could
have accepted it. He has many good qualities, is agreeable,
and I like him; he is honourable, high-minded, proud,
charitable, generous, accomplished, well-informed, and clever;
but he is weak, timid, fastidious, affected, sentimental and
very often absurd, and in no small degree a <i>humbug</i>. Altogether
he is unfit for rough work and active life, either
forensic or political.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO MR. COBDEN.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 8th.</i>&mdash;A fortnight ago on Saturday week I
went to the Grotes, at Burnham Beeches; Mrs. Butler and
Prandi, a Piedmontese patriot, and formerly refugee, now
restored by the adoption of liberal principles in Piedmont.
He was condemned to death above twenty years ago, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
escaped with great difficulty. He has lived ever since in
London.</p>

<p>On Monday we received news of the revolution in Sicily,
of the concessions extorted from the King, and since of the
promulgation of a constitution at Naples.</p>

<p>On Saturday week I read in the newspapers the speech
Cobden made at Manchester abusing the Duke of Wellington,
and scouting the national defences. On Wednesday
I wrote a letter to him in the 'Times,' which has had great
success.<a href="#Footnote_33" id="FNanchor_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
I have received innumerable compliments and
expressions of approbation about it from all quarters, and
the old Duke is pleased. I had no idea of making such a
<i>hit</i>, but the truth is, everybody was disgusted at Cobden's impertinence
and (it may be added) folly. His head is turned
by all the flattery he has received, and he has miserably
exposed himself since his return to England, showing that
he is a man of one idea and no statesman.</p>

<p>There was a meeting yesterday at Lord Stanley's to
choose a leader, but they parted without doing anything.
Stanley said it was not for him to point out a leader to
the members of the House of Commons, and he eulogised
George Bentinck, who has taken his place on the back
benches. They are to meet again to-morrow, and it is supposed
Granby<a href="#Footnote_34" id="FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
will be their choice! Except his high birth
he has not a single qualification for the post; he is tall and
good-looking, civil and good-humoured, if these are qualifications,
but he has no others; and yet this great party can
find no better man.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 10th.</i>&mdash;The Protectionists met yesterday and
elected Granby, all the world laughing at their choice. It
appears that the reports of George Bentinck's easy and good-humoured
retirement are not true.<a href="#Footnote_35" id="FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
There was an angry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
correspondence, much heat, and considerable doubt about
the successor; some being for Stafford, the majority for
Granby, in the proportions of 60 to 40.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 13th.</i>&mdash;On Friday I was with Graham for a long
time, who talked of everything, affairs at home and abroad.
He expressed a doubt if the Ministers were up to their work
and capable of coping with all their difficulties, said Peel was
'more <i>sullen</i> than he had seen him,' and had the same doubts,
but nevertheless was more than ever resolved never to take
office. He hoped, however, that Lord John might bring
forward the state of the nation on Friday, and by making
a great speech upon it show he was up to his situation;
talked a good deal of colonial matters, and said the change
in our commercial policy brought about the necessity of a
great one in our colonial policy, that we ought to limit instead
of extending our colonial empire, that Canada must
soon be independent. He condemned the Caffre war, and
extension of the Cape Colony, that we ought only to have a
<i>Gibraltar</i> there, a house of call; condemned New Zealand
and Labuan and Hong Kong; considered the West India
interest as gone, and dilated at great length (and very well)
on these points. Then on foreign affairs, which he thinks
very critical, especially estranged as we are from France,
he wants Beauvale to be sent to Paris and Vienna to concert
measures, and try to avert the dangers he apprehends.
He is for 'defence,' but says the only way is to draw our
troops home which are scattered over our useless and expensive
dependencies. He is entirely against the squadron
on the African coast and keeping up that humbug, which
he says costs directly and indirectly a million a year. I told
him Auckland said it only cost 300,000<i>l.</i>; he replied, it was
not so, and that including indirect expenses it cost a million.
The Caffres cost another million, and now that we were
going to add to the income-tax, it would only be endured
by showing that we had made or would make every practicable
reduction, and that we maintained no establishments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
that were not really necessary. He highly approved of my
letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DINNER OF LAWYERS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 18th.</i>&mdash;Dr. Sumner, Bishop of Chester, is appointed
Archbishop of Canterbury, a great mortification to
the Tractarians, and great joy to the Low Church; but he
is so excellent a man, and has done so well in his diocese,
that the appointment will be generally approved. I went
last night to the Lords to hear Lord Lansdowne bring in
the Diplomatic Bill (with Rome); he made a very good
speech.</p>

<p>I could not stay out the debate, being engaged to dine
with Chief Justice Wilde, where we had a great party almost
all lawyers, Parke, Alderson, Lushington, Talfourd. I sat
next to Alderson, and found him a very agreeable man,
Senior Wrangler, Senior Medallist, a judge (and really a
lawyer), a wit; a life all of law and letters, such as I might
have led if I had chosen the good path. I always think
of this when I meet such men who have 'scorned delights,
and lived laborious days,' and now enjoy the benefit thereof.
He told me he had been writing an exercise in the morning
for one of his sons at Oxford, a dialogue between Erasmus
and More, on the preference of the Latin to the Greek as
a universal language. There is a good saying going about
of the Court of Exchequer and its Barons; it runs thus&mdash;Parke
settles the law, Rolfe settles the fact, Alderson settles
the bar, Platt settles nothing, Pollock unsettles everything.
Campbell is anxious to write again, and talked to me of
writing the history of the Reform Bill. I told him I could
give valuable materials, but that it is not yet time. He
wants me to write memoirs of the last twenty years, and
was pleased to say no man was so well qualified to do it.
This is not true, but I have some qualifications from personal
acquaintance with the actors and knowledge of the
events of that period, and I might have had, and ought to
have had, much more, but my habits and pursuits have prevented
me, and only left me mere snatches of such real
knowledge as could be turned to account.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 20th.</i>&mdash;At the House of Lords on Friday night,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
for the Committee on the Diplomatic Bill. Government
beaten by three, and all by bad management; several who
ought to have been there, and might easily have been brought
up, were absent: the Duke of Bedford, Duke of Devonshire,
Lord Petre, a Catholic, dawdling at Brighton, and Beauvale.
The Duke of Wellington, with his deafness, got into a
complete confusion, and at the last moment voted against
Government. It was a melancholy thing to see Stanley
with Beaufort on one side of him, and Buckingham on the
other, now going into a corner with the Bishop of Exeter,
now earwigging Lord Kenyon, thus prostrating his fine
talents to the folly and bigotry of the titled, tinselled mob,
in the midst of whom he sits. Aberdeen behaved very ill,
and spoke against admitting ecclesiastics; indeed, against
any Nuncio, which was all wrong and untrue as to fact, and
which he was crammed with by Bunsen. I did not stay it
out, but went away to dinner, where I met Dr. Logan, head
of Oscott; a very able man, very pleasing and good-looking,
and neither in manner nor dress resembling a Roman
Catholic priest. He is supposed to be the writer of Lord
Shrewsbury's letters. He told Panizzi, however, that he
was sorry to find that the English Catholics were very indignant
with Lord Shrewsbury for having written these
letters, which is very strange and very lamentable, for it
has always been believed that they were more liberal and
well-disposed than the Irish, and regarded with horror the
excesses of MacHale and Co.</p>

<p>On Friday night Lord John Russell brought forward his
financial statement, in a speech which has been much
criticised. He seems to have treated the subject of defence,
and to have alluded to the military establishments of France,
in a style far from judicious; his speech and his plan were
very ill received, and the state of the House was considered
to be ominous and alarming; dissatisfaction was expressed
in all quarters, and opposition threatened upon the most
opposite grounds. Disraeli and Cobden both spoke against
him, and the former vehemently attacked the latter, and
made a very clever speech. Cobden's tone and spirit were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
bad, and, so far as can be judged of his intentions, he means
to go to work in the line of pure democracy, and with the
object of promoting the power of the middle classes over that
of the aristocracy. The most serious blow to the Government
was the speech of Francis Baring, which told mightily.
On the whole, the impression is very bad; people are gloomy,
frightened, and angry; the Government inspires no confidence;
the great monetary and commercial interests do not
think Lord John and Charles Wood equal to their situation,
and they cast back longing eyes towards Peel. This Macgregor
told me yesterday, and it is confirmed by various
signs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WHIGS AND THE PEELITES.</div>

<p>Yesterday morning John Russell sent for me, and asked
me to go to Graham and speak to him about the 'Godless'
Colleges, and the payment of professors, giving me a letter
of Clarendon's about it, which I was to show Graham with
Clarendon's scheme, and ask if it was in accordance with
their Bill, and if he and Peel would approve of it. Graham
said he did approve, and would support the scheme, but he
advised a different mode of paying the professors (by a vote
in the estimates instead of paying them out of the 7,000<i>l.</i> a
year given by the Act), which Lord John agreed to adopt.
We had much talk about the House of Commons and the
state of things. Graham thought the appearance of the
House very alarming, said Lord John spoke well in a very
difficult position, rather defended him, found fault with
some of the details of the estimates, and thought they might
have adjusted their taxation differently. Neither he nor
Peel said a word on Friday. Peel went away after Lord
John's speech. I can see that the Whigs are in a state
of continual uneasiness about Peel and Graham and the
Peelites. They hear it constantly repeated that Peel will
not take office, and has announced that he will be no leader
of a party, but they look with great apprehension towards
Lincoln, who is certainly ambitious of playing a great part,
and preparing to do so; and they suspect Peel is secretly
aiding and encouraging him. The 'Morning Chronicle'
is believed by the Government people to have been bought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
by Lincoln.<a href="#Footnote_36" id="FNanchor_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
It is certain that its tone is quite altered.
Old Delane (father of the 'Times' editor) has got the
management of it, and a Mr. Cook, who was employed for
two years under Lincoln in the Duchy of Cornwall, is
editor. When Easthope sold it, he tried to bargain for its
continued support of Palmerston, which was flatly refused.
Young Delane told me the paper meant to support the
Government, but it has begun by an attack on Grey, and
has evinced no very friendly feeling to Lord John himself.
The state of affairs is to the last degree extraordinary and
perplexing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFICULTIES OF THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>Delane came to me yesterday morning to talk over the
ministerial <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="presentation">exposé</i> and its effects. He said nothing could
be worse, that it was <i>fatal</i>, that there was no use in
attempting to defend them. He found people in the City
all against the plan, that it could not pass; and he talked of
nothing but defeat and resignation, without being able to
suggest any possible alternative. He says, however, that
people don't care for this, that they are reckless, that the
Government must not look to be carried through, <i>for fear
they should resign</i>, and because there is nobody to take their
places; that nobody will be frightened by this, but that
their measure will be opposed, let what may come of it.
Others think differently, and Tom Baring told me last night
that he thought, notwithstanding the discontent, they would
find support enough for their purpose. It is difficult, however,
as yet, in the midst of the uncertainty, excitement, and
discontent that prevail, to form any plausible conclusion as
to their prospect. There can be no doubt that, as a Government,
their position is very unenviable; they are not strong
in numbers&mdash;that is, they have not an absolute majority of
the House of Commons&mdash;and they are in a minority in the
House of Lords. They enjoy no confidence, and no favour;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
neither collectively nor individually are they strong in
public confidence and attachment. There is no enmity to
them, and they have a sort of negative support, as being
well-intentioned, honest, tolerably capable, and, from the
state of parties, the only possible Government. But they
are surrounded with cavilling, discontented people, and
fragments of parties, all animated with particular objects
and designs of their own, which are not yet ripe&mdash;people
biding their time, and looking for their overthrow. There
are the Protectionists, without any leader, and absolutely
unable to find one; the Peelite staff, with a dozen men fit
to lead, and most of them willing, but still kept asunder by
the old film of political repulsion, the ever-burning hatred of
Peel and Peelites on one side, and the honour and feeling
which forbids any desertion of, or disrespect to, Peel on the
other; and these feelings will still keep the two Conservative
sections in this antagonistic state, till events and common
interests, Heaven knows how or when, bring them together.
There are, however, enormous difficulties, inherent in such
a state of things, and aggravated by their continuance,
and among them none greater than Stanley's position, and
the egregious folly of his conduct. This is, in truth, the
great security which the present Government has for keeping
in office. If they are defeated, and offer to resign,
no other Government will be found possible, and they
will be forced to stay in; but I doubt much, even in such
a contingency, if they would be able to do so entirely on
their own terms, and they would never dare to make public
opinion, if unmistakeably expressed, surrender at discretion.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 23rd.</i>&mdash;On Monday night Wood came suddenly
down to the House of Commons, and proposed to refer the
Army and Navy Estimates to a secret Committee, and then
the miscellaneous estimates. This scheme was violently
attacked, particularly the secrecy. Disraeli spoke forcibly
against it. Peel came to the rescue. The effect was very
bad: a confession of weakness and perplexity, and the Government
lost credit. Last night Wood again proposed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Committees, owned he was wrong about their being <i>secret</i>,
and asked for 'select.' Disraeli attacked him very severely;
Peel came forward handsomely, spoke for the Committees,
but defended the estimates, and talked very sensibly about
them and defences, ridiculing Ellesmere's letter very much.
Delane had a long interview with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer the day before yesterday, who told him he had
been driven to his present expedient by the deplorable effect
of Lord John's speech, which appears to have inflicted
<i>tortures</i> on his colleagues all the time he was delivering it.
He not only (Wood said) said all that he ought not to have
done, and made great mistakes in his way of dealing with
the subject, but he omitted a great part of what he was to
have said, two points especially: Ireland, and what had been
done there, and the Spanish marriage question, <i>which it had
been his intention to throw over</i>! It certainly is remarkable
that he showed none of the tact and dexterity which usually
pre-eminently distinguish him; he had not been well, and
was oppressed with the subject. The effect was very bad,
and, as usual, his meaning ridiculously distorted and misrepresented.
All the friends of the Government are exceedingly
alarmed, and we do certainly appear to be very near
a deadlock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD WILLIAM HERVEY.</div>

<p>In reference to the Spanish marriage question, I have
had some concern in stopping what would have been a very
mischievous publication. William Hervey, who is mad on
it, has written an elaborate <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="polemic">polémique</i> in the shape of a
pamphlet, or rather book. He sent this over last summer to
Clarendon, who, not having time to read it, asked George
Lewis to prepare it for, and correct, the press; but first it
was sent to Palmerston. He kept it some months, and about
Christmas sent it to Lewis, with his imprimatur; Lewis, by
accident, mentioned it to me just as he was correcting the
last sheets. I thought it so objectionable that I begged
him not to let it be published without John Russell's knowledge
and approval. Lord John said he would not let it
appear, for such a publication, at the moment when the
Duchesse de Montpensier's <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="pregnancy">grossesse</i> is announced, would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, February 28th, 1848.</i>&mdash;The French Revolution
has driven for the time every other subject out of thought,
and so astounding has the event been, so awful and surprising
from its inconceivable rapidity and the immensity of
the operation, that every mind has been kept in a restless
whirl and tumult incompatible with calm reflexion; while
from the quick succession of events crowding on each other,
all dashed with lies, false reports, exaggerations, and errors,
it has been almost impossible to sit down and give a clear,
connected, and true account of what has happened; to jot
down from hour to hour all that one hears would only have
been to say one moment what must have been unsaid the
next. By degrees the facts develope themselves and the
fictions are cast aside; but the time is not yet arrived for
completing this historical process. There are people alive
who remember the whole of the first Revolution, and we of
middle age are all familiar with the second; but this, the
third, transcends them both, and all other events which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
history records, in the astonishing political phenomena which
it displays. The first Revolution was a long and gradual
act, extending over years, in which the mind traces an
elaborate concatenation of causes and effects. The second
was not unexpected; the causes were working openly and
ominously; and at last the great stroke so rashly attempted,
and by which the contest was provoked, was only the concluding
scene of a drama which for a long preceding time
had been in a state of representation before the world. In
1789 everybody saw that a revolution was inevitable; in
1830 everybody thought that it was probable; but in 1848,
up to the very moment at which the explosion took place,
and even for a considerable time after it (that is, considerable
in reference to the period which embraced the whole
thing from first to last), no human being dreamt of a revolution
and of the dethronement of the King. The power of
the Government appeared to be immense and unimpaired.
The King was still considered one of the wisest and boldest
of men, with a thorough knowledge of the country and the
people he ruled; and though his prudence and that of his
Ministers had been greatly impugned by their mode of
dealing with the question of Parliamentary reform, the
worst that anybody anticipated was the fall of Guizot's
Cabinet, and that reform of some sort it would be found
necessary to concede. But no one imagined that the King,
defended by an army of 100,000 men and the fortifications
of Paris (which it was always said he had cunningly devised
to give himself full power over the capital), was exposed to
any personal risk and danger. There was a strong reforming
and, it might be, a strong republican or revolutionary
spirit abroad, but the principal leaders of Opposition were
understood to have no designs against the monarchy, and it
was believed by those who had good opportunities of knowing
that the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="middle class">bourgeoisie</i> of Paris were comparatively indifferent to
political questions, averse to revolutionary movements, and
the determined advocates of order and tranquillity. For
some time before the day appointed for the Reform banquet,
much anxiety prevailed for the peace of the capital; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
when it was announced that the Government did not mean
to interfere, and that the question of the legality of the
meeting was to be referred to a judicial decision, all apprehension
subsided; and when the proclamation of Odilon
Barrot and the chiefs of the Banquet appeared, it was
regarded as a false and imprudent step, which by putting
the Ministers in the right would only seem to strengthen
their authority and avert their downfall, which otherwise
had been probable. Duchâtel made a very good speech in
the Chamber of Deputies, and proved that this last act was
so clearly illegal and mischievous that the Ministers were
bound to take the course they did; and as the banqueters
showed a disposition to obey the Government, nobody
doubted that the whole affair would end quietly.</p>

<p>When therefore this great and sudden insurrection took
place, sweeping everything before it with the irresistible
speed and violence of a hurricane, everybody here stood
aghast; but for the first two days no one anticipated the
final catastrophe. At Paris, from the King downwards, all
seem to have lost their presence of mind and judgement.
The state of things proved the fallacy of their former calculations
and expectations, and their minds seemed incapable
of keeping up with the march of events, of embracing the
magnitude of the danger, and of discerning the means by
which it could be met. Everything was involved in perplexity
and confusion; the roar of insurrectionary Paris
affrighted the ears and bewildered the senses of the inmates
of the Tuileries. At the moment I am writing we are still
ignorant of the minute details of all that passed, of what the
King said and did, and how others played their several parts.
We know that Guizot resigned, that Molé was appointed&mdash;a
capital fault, for Molé was another Guizot, and the selection
only proved how unconscious the King was of the precipice
on the brink of which he was standing. Some precious
hours were lost in Molé's abortive attempt. Then came
Thiers and Odilon Barrot, Ministers of a few hours, who,
seduced by the deceptive applause of the rabble, fancied
they could command and restrain the people of Paris, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
who persuaded the King to withdraw the troops, telling him
they would answer for the people. This fatal advice cost
him the Crown, which, perhaps, he could not have kept on
his head. The tide swept on; a host of people, and among
them Emile Girardin, rushed to the Tuileries, told the King
his life was menaced, and advised him to abdicate; he
refused. The people about him, and his own son amongst
them (Duc de Montpensier), pressed him, and he signed the
act of abdication. Still the crowd pressed on, and the palace
was unprotected. He resolved, or was persuaded, to fly;
and with the Queen and such of his family as were with him
he quitted the palace with such precipitation that they had
no time to take anything, and they had scarcely any money
amongst them. They proceeded to Dreux, where they
separated, and as yet no one knows where the King is, or
where those of his family are who are not yet arrived in
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FALL OF LOUIS PHILIPPE.</div>

<p>The Duchesse d'Orléans, after the terrible scene in the
Chamber of Deputies, was taken to some house in or near
Paris, where she now lies concealed. All these events passed
with the velocity of an express train; hardly an interval was
placed between circumstances and conditions of the most
opposite description. No monarchy or monarch ever fell
with such superhuman rapidity. There is something awful
and full of fear and pity in the contemplation of such a
tremendous vicissitude: of a great King and a numerous
and prosperous family, not many hours before reposing in
the security of an apparently impregnable power, suddenly
toppled down from this magnificent eminence and laid
prostrate in the dust, covered with ignominy and reproach,
and pursued by terror and grief. All at once the whole
edifice of grandeur and happiness fell to the ground; it
dissolved, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, left not
a rack behind. The flight was undignified. It would be
hard to accuse Louis Philippe of want of courage, of which
he has given on various occasions many signal proofs; but
he certainly displayed no resolution on this occasion. It is
very doubtful whether his person would have been injured;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the people have evinced no thirst for blood. It was then,
indeed, too late for resistance, for the means had been withdrawn;
but it may fairly be asked if it would not have been
the more becoming and the wiser course to affront the
danger of popular rage, and to have tried what might have
been done by firmness, by reason, and by concession at the
same time. All this is speculation. It may be that his life
and that of his Queen would have been sacrificed; but on a
more terrible occasion, when the same palace was invaded
by a more formidable mob, a King still more unpopular and
a detested Queen were left uninjured; and it is far more
probable that the abdication of Louis Philippe would have
satisfied and disarmed the wrath and fury of the people.
At all events it is certain that he descended from the throne
in a manner which, if it is cruel to call it ignominious,
was not rendered captivating or affecting by any of those
touching or striking circumstances which often environ and
decorate the sacrifice of fallen majesty.</p>

<p>There is a strong impression that if they had unsparingly
used the military means at their disposal while it was still
time, the monarchy would have been saved and the tumult
suppressed. The recollection of the 13th Vendémiaire and
the Place St. Roch, when the troops of the Convention
defeated the Sections of Paris, produces this notion. But
when the time was given to the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riot">émeute</i> to grow and expand,
and when the National Guards took part in it, all was over;
for the troops of the line, who would have repressed the
mob, would not fight against the National Guards. Between
blunders, bad advice, and delay, the insurrection sprang
at once into gigantic proportions, and the world has seen
with amazement a King who was considered so astute and
courageous, with sons full of spirit and intelligence, sink
without striking a blow for their kingdom, perishing without
a struggle, and consequently falling dishonoured and unregretted.
The end of Charles X. was far more dignified
than that of his cousin, and the survivors of that shipwreck
may see with a melancholy satisfaction their successful competitor
'whelmed in deeper gulfs' than themselves. Louis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Philippe has been seventeen years on the throne; in many
respects a very amiable man, and, though crafty and unscrupulous
as a politician, and neither beloved nor respected,
he has never done anything to make himself an object of the
excessive hatred and bitter feelings which have been exhibited
against him and his family. The mob, though, on
the whole, moderate and good-humoured, have been violent
against his person, and they plundered the Palais Royal,
invaded the Tuileries, and burnt Neuilly to show their
abhorrence of him. This manifestation is a cruel commentary
on his reign and his character as King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF THE FUGITIVES.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, March 5th.</i>&mdash;The fugitives have all arrived here
day by day with the exception of the Duchesse d'Orléans
and her children, who are supposed to be in Germany. The
King and Queen came yesterday from Newhaven, where
they landed; Madame de Lieven and Guizot the day before,
the one from Paris, the other through Belgium; they were
in the same train (leaving Paris at seven o'clock on Thursday
night), but neither knew the other was there. The King, as
soon as he reached England, wrote a letter to the Queen, in
which he gave her to understand that he considered all as
over with him, and he said that it was the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Neuilly</i>
who thanked her for all her past and present kindness to
himself and his family. It was a very good letter (Lord
Lansdowne tells me), and the Queen was much moved by it.
Her personal resentment had long ceased; Aberdeen told me
last night that she had told him so not long ago, and that
though the political question was another thing, her personal
feelings towards the French Royal Family were what they
had ever been.</p>

<p>Yesterday I saw Madame de Lieven, and heard her
narrative, both personal and historical. With the sufferers,
as with the spectators, the predominant feeling is one of
intense astonishment amounting to a sort of incredulity;
every one repeats (as well they may) that nothing that
history has recorded, or fiction invented, ever approached
this wonderful reality, wonderful in every way, in its whole
and in all its parts, There is nothing in it that is not contrary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to every antecedent probability, to all preconceived
notions of the characters of the principal actors, and to the
way in which almost everybody concerned might have been
expected to act. The beginning, the middle, and the end
of the contest have been equally wonderful: the conduct of
the old Government and the conduct of the new; the events
of months or years crammed into a few days or hours; the
whole change so vast and complete, made as at the stroke of
an enchanter's wand. France, on Monday, February 22nd, a
powerful, peaceful, and apparently impregnable Monarchy;
on Wednesday, 24th of the same month, the whole of her
Royalty scattered over the face of the earth, and France
become a Republic no less powerful and peaceful; the
authority of the latter form of government as generally
acknowledged as that of the former was a week before; and
an able, vigorous, and despotic Government established in
the name of the people, which was, with universal consent
and approbation, and the admiration even of those whom it
had displaced, discharging every legislative as well as executive
function.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCESS LIEVEN ON THE REVOLUTION.</div>

<p>Madame de Lieven's story runs thus. On Sunday&mdash;that
is, this day fortnight&mdash;she had a reception as usual. No
alarm prevailed, but she was a little struck by Delessert telling
her that there was a good deal of agitation amongst
some of the lower orders of workmen, and those who were
known to the Government as Communists; still he did not
appear to attach much importance to it. On Monday evening
Guizot told her that it was possible there might be some
rioting and disturbance in the streets the following day, and
he advised her to go out of her house for a few hours in the
morning, which she did, ordering her dinner and meaning to
return. That same day the commotions began, but still the
Ministers were unterrified; and though the affair began to be
serious, they never doubted that they should be able to suppress
the tumult and restore order. Everything went on, as
is well known, up to Wednesday morning, when Guizot saw
the King, told him all would go right, and went to the
Chamber. While there Duchâtel called him out, and told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
him the King wanted him directly at the Tuileries. He was
surprised, asked for what, and proposed they should go
together, which they did. When they got there they found
the King much disturbed; he said the Commandant of a
Legion of the National Guard had been to him and told
him they must have reform, and he was afraid the rest of
the National Guard would follow the example. 'Well,' said
Guizot, 'if they do, we shall have no difficulty in putting
down such a demonstration.' 'Oh, but,' said the King, 'that
will produce bloodshed, and may lead to lamentable events;'
and then, after beating about the bush a good deal, and with
many expressions of personal attachment to Guizot, he said,
'Perhaps a change of Ministers might settle everything, and
relieve him from his embarrassment.' Guizot at once said
that the mere suggestion of such a thing made it '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="a case resolved">une affaire
résolue</span>,' and if His Majesty thought that by taking any other
Ministers he could improve the state of his affairs, he, of
course, ought to do so. The King then talked of his regrets,
and that he would rather abdicate than part with him.
Guizot said abdication was not to be thought of. The King
then talked of sending for Molé, and Guizot assured him of
his readiness to support Molé, or any other man who would
maintain Conservative principles. He then returned to the
Chamber, and announced that the Ministers were out. The
Conservatives were struck with astonishment and alarm;
crowded round Guizot, and asked him if he had resigned. He
said 'No; that he had been dismissed.' Molé was sent for,
and said he would try and form a Government. The King
said he had only one exclusion to insist on: that Bugeaud
should not command the troops. Molé said it was the very
first appointment he should propose to His Majesty. The
King wanted to keep the command in the hands of his sons.
Molé went away to try his hand. Meanwhile the agitation
of Paris increased. At night, hearing nothing of Molé, the
King sent Pasquier to him; he found him alone. 'Well, is
your Government formed?' 'No, not yet; but I expect to
see Passy to-morrow morning.' He was told this would not
do, and while he had been thus wasting time, the movement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
was swelling and advancing. So Molé went to the
Palace at ten at night, and threw the thing up. Then the
King sent for Thiers and Odilon Barrot. Thiers made it a
condition that the troops should not act for twelve hours,
and said he would meanwhile answer for the people. The
King consented, and he and Odilon Barrot went out into the
streets on horseback to harangue the mob, announce their
Ministry, and send them home satisfied; they were received
with menaces and shots, and sent about their business.
They went back to the Tuileries and said all was over, and
they could do nothing. Early in the morning (Thursday
morning) the state of affairs having become more and more
formidable, a host of people came to the Tuileries (Emile
Girardin amongst them), and all urged the King to abdicate.
He asked Thiers what he advised. Thiers had lost his head,
and said he was not his Minister, and could give no advice;
all the rest (none more urgently than the Duc de Montpensier)
pressed the King to abdicate. The King was
reluctant, and Piscatory alone entreated him not to do so.
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="We must never abdicate, Sire,">Il ne faut jamais abdiquer, Sire,</span>' he said to him; '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="now is the time to go ride and be seen">voilà le
moment de monter à cheval et de vous montrer</span>.' The Queen
behaved like a heroine. She who was so mild and religious,
and who never took any part in public affairs, alone showed
firmness and resolution; she thanked Piscatory for his advice
to the King, and said, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="My friend, you should not abdicate; rather die as King">Mon ami, il ne faut pas abdiquer;
plutôt mourez en Roi</span>.' But the more disgraceful counsel
prevailed. He abdicated, and hurried off, as we know.
Piscatory was with him to the last, and the Queen, on parting
from him, told him to tell Guizot that she owed to him
all she had enjoyed of happiness for the last six years. Thus
fell the Orleans dynasty, <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="pitifully, shamefully">pitoyablement, honteusement</i>, without
respect or sympathy. 'Where,' I asked, 'were the sons, and
what did they do?' Madame de Lieven only shook her head.
She herself had taken refuge at St. Aulaire's, then at Apponyi's,
then at an Austrian attaché's; then Pierre d'Aremberg
took her under his care, and hid her at Mr. Roberts',
the English painter, who brought her to England as Mrs.
Roberts, with gold and jewels secreted in her dress. Guizot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
was concealed one day at Piscatory's, the other at the Duc
de Broglie's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREATNESS OF LAMARTINE.</div>

<p>In all this great drama Lamartine stands forth pre-eminently
as the principal character; how long it may last
God only knows, but such a fortnight of greatness the world
has hardly ever seen; for fame and glory with posterity it
were well for him to die now. His position is something
superhuman <i>at this moment</i>; the eyes of the universe are
upon him, and he is not only the theme of general admiration
and praise, but on him almost alone the hopes of the
world are placed. He is the principal author of this Revolution;
they say that his book has been a prime cause of it;<a href="#Footnote_38" id="FNanchor_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
and that which he has had the glory of directing, moderating,
restraining. His labour has been stupendous, his eloquence
wonderful. When the new Government was surrounded by
thousands of armed rabble, bellowing and raging for they
knew not what, Lamartine contrived to appease their rage,
to soften, control, and eventually master them; so great a
trial of eloquence was hardly ever heard of. Then from the
beginning he has exhibited undaunted courage and consummate
skill, proclaiming order, peace, humanity, respect for
persons and property. This improvised Cabinet, strangely
composed, has evinced most curious vigour, activity, and
wisdom; they have forced everybody to respect them; but
Lamartine towers above them all, and is the presiding genius
of the new creation. He has acted like a man of honour and
of feeling too. He offered the King an escort; he wrote to
Madame Guizot and told her her son was safe in England,
and caused the report of this to be spread abroad that he
might not be sought for; and, moreover, he sent to Guizot
to say if he was not in safety where he was he might come
to his house. When he first proposed the abolition of the
punishment of death he was overruled; but the next day he
proposed it again, and declared if his colleagues would not
consent he would throw up his office, quit the concern, and
they might make him if they pleased the first victim of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
law they would not abolish. All this is very great in the
man who the Duc de Broglie told me was so bad, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="a bad book by a bad man">un mauvais
livre par un mauvais homme</span>,' and consequently all France
is praying for the continuation of the life and power of
Lamartine; and the exiles whom he has been principally
instrumental in driving from their country are all loud in
praise and admiration of his humanity and his capacity.</p>

<p>Aberdeen saw Guizot yesterday; he is in good health and
spirits, and wants for nothing. He told Aberdeen that for
the last two years he thought there was a considerable alteration
in the King's mind; that he was <i>occasionally</i> as vigorous
as ever, but on the whole that he was changed for the worse.
This makes Guizot's conduct during these two years only the
more inexcusable. He thinks (as everybody else does) that
this fine fabric which has risen like an exhalation will not
last long, and he said, 'You English bet about everything;
if I was compelled to bet, I should for choice take the Duchesse
d'Orléans and her sons as the most probable eventuality where
everything is so uncertain.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. GUIZOT'S NARRATIVE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 6th.</i>&mdash;I called on Guizot yesterday; found several
people there, and Delessert, who was telling his story and all
that had happened to him. Then Guizot told us his, which,
though it is essentially the same as what Madame de Lieven
told me, as it is more circumstantial and in some respects
different I will not pass over. He began with the morning
of Wednesday, when he went to the Tuileries and transacted
business with the King as usual; thence to the Chambers.
Duchâtel called him out, and they went to the Tuileries together.
In the way there Duchâtel told him that the King was
very uneasy and alarmed at the reform petitions which had
been presented to him by the National Guards, and had been
talking of changing the Government and sending for Molé.
When they arrived the King addressed Guizot in this sense,
said that he had received petitions from this and that officer
of the Garde Nationale, and that all the rest would follow
their example; that they all asked for Reform, and for the
dismissal of the Ministers. Guizot said he was quite ready
to face the difficulty, having the support of the Chambers;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
but that he must have that of the King also. The King
then sent for the Queen and the two Dukes of Nemours and
Montpensier, and they all joined with the King in urging
on Guizot the necessity of a change of Ministers to appease
the clamour that had been raised. Guizot said that from
the moment the King and the Royal Family signified such
an opinion and such a desire to him, it was '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="a case resolved">une affaire
résolue</span>,' and it was his duty to submit to their pleasure.
The King asked him if he thought Molé could form a
Government. He said, 'Yes, he might;' and that he
should certainly have his best support if he made the
attempt. The King appears not to have been quite decided;
but while they were still conversing some one arrived from
the Chamber and informed Guizot that he must return there
directly, as an <i>interpellation</i> was going to be made to him.
He said to the King that he must return and tell the
Chamber what the state of things was, and on what His
Majesty thought fit finally to decide. The King said that
he might announce that he had sent for Molé to form a
Government. Guizot returned to the Chamber and made
the announcement, which was received with astonishment
and indignation by the Conservative deputies, who crowded
round him and enquired if he had resigned, crying out,
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="We are abandoned">Nous sommes abandonnés</span>.' He replied that he had not
resigned, but had been dismissed. From the Chamber he
returned to the Tuileries, and told the King what had
passed there. The King said he had sent for Molé who
had undertaken to try and form a Government. Meanwhile
affairs were getting worse in the town, and the concession
of the King had of course encouraged the factious. Guizot,
who could not return home, went to the Duc de Broglie and
went to bed. Not long after, at one in the morning, he was
called up by a message desiring him to come to the Tuileries
forthwith; he went, when the King told him he had just
heard from Molé that he had tried Passy, Dufaure, and
Billault, who had all refused, and consequently that he could
not form a Government. His Majesty said that he was now
disposed to give the command of the troops to Marshal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Bugeaud, and that of the National Guard to Lamoricière,
and let them put down the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riot">émeute</i>. Guizot said it was the
best thing he could do, and he would sign the decree if he
would make it. This was immediately done. Meanwhile
the King had sent for Thiers, who came, accepted the office
of forming a Government, but desired that Odilon Barrot
might be joined with him, to which the King agreed. Thiers
and Barrot then insisted that for some hours the military
should not be allowed to act, and they undertook to pacify
the people and put an end to the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riot">émeute</i>. The King having
consented to this, they mounted on horseback and went off
in different directions to harangue the people and announce
their Ministry. They were severally received with hisses,
uproar, and in some instances shots, and returned to the
palace and announced their failure. By this time there was
an affluence of people at the Tuileries; the storm without
increased and approached; the military, who were without
orders, did nothing, and all was over. I asked Delessert
whether the troops were well disposed. He said, 'Perfectly.'
Guizot said, 'My entire conviction is, that if Bugeaud had
acted the moment he took the command, everything would
have been over before nine o'clock.' When the King was
pressed to resign, Piscatory said to him, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Majesty, if you sign your abdication, you will not have reigned">Sire, si vous signez
votre abdication, vous n'aurez pas régné</span>.' Guizot told me
that the Government had long been aware of the secret
societies, but never could ascertain who were their chiefs;
that their intention had been to delay their republican
attempt till the death of the King, but that they had
changed this plan on the Tuesday night, and resolved to
seize the present occasion. I told him we had always supposed
the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="middle class">bourgeoisie</i> of Paris, composing the bulk of the
National Guard, to be disposed to order, and that they would
have maintained it. He said the great majority of them
were so, but that the well-disposed had not come forth, while
the factious minority had. Moreover, 'you English cannot
conceive what our lowest class is: your own is a mere mob
without courage or organisation, and not given to politics;
ours on the contrary, the lowest class, is eager about politics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
and with a perfect military organisation, and therefore most
formidable.' I said Lamartine had done very well. He said
yes, and praised him, though not very cordially; and he
added that he was a man who had always wanted to be in
the first place, and had never been able to accomplish it.
He had tried it in the Legitimist party, and had found
Berryer; in the Conservatives, and had found him (Guizot);
and in the Opposition, where he was met by Thiers. On the
present occasion (he might have added) he had found Odilon
Barrot, but he managed to give him the go-by. He and
Odilon Barrot were at the meeting on Tuesday when the
attempt was determined on, and Odilon Barrot wanted to
try the intermediate measure of the Regency and the
Duchess of Orleans; but Lamartine flung himself at once
into the Republic, and thus crushed his colleague and placed
himself without a rival at the head of the movement. Guizot
said all this could not last; that France had no desire for a
Republic; everybody had adhered from fear or prudence.
He expected, however, that there would be a great battle in
the streets of Paris within a few days between the Republicans
and the Communists, in which the former would
prevail, because the National Guard would support the
former.<a href="#Footnote_39" id="FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">M. GUIZOT'S ESCAPE.</div>

<p>He gave us an account of his own personal adventures,
which were very simple. He left the Ministry of the Interior
with Madame Duchâtel, Duc de Broglie, and two other
people; and he was first taken to a house where he was told
he would be safe, and conducted by the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="doorwoman to the fifth floor">portière au cinquième</i>.
She entered the room after him and said, 'You are M.
Guizot.' He said, 'I am.' 'Fear nothing,' she said; 'you
are safe here. You have always defended honest people, and
I will take care nobody comes near you.' In the evening he
went to the Duc de Broglie's; he was one day at Piscatory's;
and on Wednesday night he left Paris as somebody's servant.
He said he was never in danger, as the Government would
have been sorry to apprehend him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 7th.</i>&mdash;The French Revolution has been so absorbing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
as well as exciting that I have never found time to write
about domestic affairs, so what I have now to say must be
put in narrative form instead of that of journal. I have
been in continual communication with Graham for some
time past, especially during Charles Wood's income tax
agony. Graham, who is by way of being very friendly to the
Government (but is evidently not sorry to see their mismanagement
and unpopularity), said so much of the difficulty
they would have in carrying the two per cent. that
I went to Charles Wood and told him what I had heard.
I found him very uneasy, and he owned to me that he had
received similar opinions from many other quarters. The
same night (a Saturday) I met him at Lady Palmerston's,
when he asked me to find out from Graham what substitute
he would propose. I saw Graham on Sunday, when he
more strongly urged the necessity of abandoning the addition,
saying nothing would enable them to carry it; and he
said, in answer to my enquiry, that he should take the
money the Chancellor wanted from the reserve in hand&mdash;in
short, just what the Government eventually did. I saw
Charles Wood the same night, and told him what Graham
recommended, and this advice they took.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSITION OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.</div>

<p>After this, and indeed before it too, Graham and I had
many conversations about the Government, its state and
prospects, John Russell and his health, Peel and political
probabilities and possibilities. We agreed that the Government
was much damaged, weak and unpopular, and would
have difficulty in going on, especially if, as seemed most
likely, Lord John's health gave way, and he should be
forced to retire. I said nothing would then be possible but
Peel. On this he made me a speech, declaring Peel was impossible.
He was, in the first place, determined not to take
office; Lady Peel, who has great influence with him, doing her
best to dissuade him; but, besides personal reluctance and
objections, his position puts him out of the question. The
Protectionists hate him as much as ever, and he hates them
with equal intensity; he abhors what he considers their
ingratitude as well as their folly, and nothing would induce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
him to have anything to do with them, even if they would
with him; therefore he has no party. In the House of Lords
he has not ten followers: how then, in a country which can
only be governed by party, can he become Minister? That
to think of putting himself at the head of a Whig party
would be absurd: at sixty years old to begin such a strange
career would be ridiculous. He said a great deal more in
the same strain, all very plausible and not easy to answer;
and the conclusion from which was that, for various reasons,
Peel would not under any circumstances be Minister again.
But in the meantime the reports of Lord John's declining
health gained ground; the weakness of the Government
became more apparent; the Radicals declared war against
them; and one person after another began to turn his eyes
towards Peel. There was some talk about sending for
Clarendon, which I wrote to him; and in reply he entreated
me to extinguish any such idea if I met with it; and he then
demonstrated that Peel was a necessity and the only alternative.
So many people in different ways said the same thing
to me, that I told Graham. He was (or affected to be) still
impressed with all the insuperable obstacles to Peel's return,
amongst which he himself and Aberdeen were considerable,
as Peel would never return without both of them, and they
were particularly odious to the Whigs. I said <i>he</i> was not
popular with them, but neither was he so odious; and they
knew very well that if Peel returned, he must and would
return with him. As to Aberdeen it was different, because
he had behaved so ill ever since he left office, and opposed
the Government in the most unfair and ungenerous manner.
He said Peel never would have Palmerston at the Foreign
Office, and would want Aberdeen there, in whom all his
confidence was placed: not but what Aberdeen would be very
ready to make any sacrifice. I told him that it was evident
there was but one way by which Peel could return to office,
and that was the arrival of a state of things which at once
rendered him a great public necessity, and the urgency of
which would make his refusal impossible; that he must be
invited by the whole Whig party, not as a favour due to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
him but as a sacrifice exacted from him; and that this must
be done heartily, sincerely, and in a spirit of unselfishness,
and on public and patriotic grounds. Since this Lord John
Russell has taken himself off to Hastings to try and get
well. As Graham tells Peel everything I say, the latter
now knows well what is thought and expected, and he has
only so to conduct himself as to make the adhesion and
overtures of the Whig party possible and not difficult when
the time and occasion are ripe. The matter is replete with
difficulties, and nothing but a great exigency can smooth
them away. At present there are too many jealousies and
animosities afloat; there is too much of suspicion, distrust,
and old dislike lingering in men's minds to admit of the
desired amalgamation; and unhappily the characters of the
principal actors, both of John Russell and Peel, are extremely
ill suited to deal with such a delicate and difficult state of
affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE OF PARIS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;Lord John Russell is better, and writes
word confidently from Hastings that he shall return convalescent.
Yesterday I saw Southern and Mrs. Austin, both
just arrived from Paris. They have each been writing letters
the last two or three days in the 'Times,' which are excellent
descriptions of the state of affairs in France. Nothing
can be more deplorable than it all is, and daily getting worse:
no confidence, no work, and everything threatening frightful
financial and commercial difficulties, and a general expectation
of confusion, violence, and bloodshed. Southern told
me that the dissensions in the Provisional Government were
great, and the discussions violent; Lamartine often in a
minority; no regular parties formed, but a continual dividing
and crossing on different subjects. Lamartine wanted
to omit what he said in his Circular about the Treaties of
1815, but was overruled. Southern thinks the Provisional
Government will quarrel and break up before the Chambers
can meet. They both agree that all France abhors this
Revolution, but notwithstanding the bitter and universal
regret that it has occasioned, and will still more hereafter,
that nobody thinks of endeavouring to restore the monarchy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
in any way or under any head. The King was not so unpopular
as Guizot, and they confirm all previous impressions,
that not only he might have been saved, but that nothing
but a series of fatal and inconceivable blunders and the most
deplorable weakness could have upset him. The causes of
this prodigious effect were ludicrously small. Southern declares
there were not above 4,000 armed men of the populace
actually employed; but the troops were everywhere
paralysed, boys carried off the cannon from the midst of
them without resistance. No one has the slightest conception
what turn matters will take, but all seem to be of
opinion they will have nothing to do with the Bonapartes.
The Orleanses are now detested, and even the Legitimists
do not look to the Duc de Bordeaux, because he is a poor
creature, has no children, and they believe is not likely
to have any; therefore it would not be worth while to
restore a dynasty which would end with him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 11th.</i>&mdash;Guizot received a letter from the Duc de
Broglie yesterday, in which he said that Paris was quiet on
the day he wrote, but such was the state of things that any
day it might be the scene of confusion and rapine. I asked
Madame de Lieven what the policy of the Government had
been about Reform. She said, King, Duchâtel, and Guizot
had all been determined against Reform; the latter willing
to concede a very little, but always resolved to keep the
Conservative majority, with which Reform was incompatible.
I asked why, after having allowed the banquets in the provinces,
they would not suffer that in the capital? The reply
was very insufficient: because they did not like to stop the
expression of public opinions in the country generally; but at
Paris, when and where the Chambers were assembled, those
opinions might have been expressed in them. I met Guizot
at dinner at the Hollands'; he goes about everywhere, is
very cheerful, and puts a good face on it; everybody is very
civil to him, and he feels the kindness of his reception, especially
as he knows he has been personally obnoxious since
the Spanish marriages. He said last night, that he considered
the payment of the members of the Convention fatal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to the composition of that Assembly. The old revolutionary
Assemblies never paid their members. Napoleon was the
first who introduced that custom: his Senators were paid
30,000 fr.; his Deputies 10,000 fr. Guizot went to see the
King and Queen two days ago: the interview was very
affecting; both threw themselves on his neck; the King is
the most <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="downcast">abattu</i> of the two; he has no money.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING'S NARRATIVE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 12th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday Lady Granville and Lady Georgiana
Fullerton went to Claremont to see the Royal Family.
The Queen was gone to town, but they were received by the
King, who talked to them for an hour and gave them a narrative
of his adventures, which they related to me last night.
It was very carious, that is, curious as an exhibition of his
character. He described his flight, and all his subsequent
adventures, his travels, his disguises, his privations, the dangers
he incurred, the kindness and assistance he met with,
all very minutely. They said it was very interesting, and
even very amusing; admirably well told. He was occasionally
pathetic and occasionally droll; his story was told with
a mixture of the serious and the comic&mdash;sometimes laughing
and at others almost crying&mdash;that was very strange. It struck
them that he was very undignified, even vulgar, and above
all that he seemed to be animated with no feeling towards
his country, but to view the whole history through the
medium of <i>self</i>. He said of the French, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="They chose their fate; I have to bear mine">Ils ont choisi leur
sort; je dois supporter le mien</span>.' He gave a very different
account of what passed from that of Guizot. He said he
was in personal danger when he was on horseback reviewing
the National Guard on Thursday morning; that they pressed
round him, shouting for reform. He cried out, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="' But you have it, the reform; let me pass">Mais vous
l'avez, la réforme; laissez-moi passer donc</span>;' and that he was
obliged to spur his horse through the mob, and got back to
the Tuileries with difficulty. He said he had <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="asked">posé la question</i>
of resistance to Guizot, who had refused to entertain it,
said that he could not give orders to fire on the National
Guards. Their two statements are quite irreconcileable, and
thus occur historical perplexities and the errors and untruths
which crowd all history. I have always said that it is nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
but a series of conventional facts. There is no <i>absolute</i> truth
in history; mankind arrives at probable results and conclusions
in the best way it can, and by collecting and comparing
evidence it settles down its ideas and its belief to a certain
chain and course of events which it accepts as certain, and
deals with as if it were, because it must settle somewhere
and on something, and because a tolerable <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primâ facie</i> and
probable case is presented. But when one sees how the
actors in and spectators of the same events differ in narrating
and describing them; how continually complete contradictions
are discovered to facts the most generally believed;
there is no preserving the mind from a state of scepticism,
nor is it possible to read or hear anything with entire satisfaction
and faith. It appears that the Royal Family have
no money, the King having invested his whole fortune in
France, and beggary is actually staring them in the face.
The King evinced no bitterness except in speaking of the
English newspapers, especially the 'Times;' and he attributed
much of his unpopularity, and what he considers the
unjust prejudices against him, to the severity of their <i>personal</i>
attacks on him! Curious enough this; but as he felt
these philippics so acutely, why did he not take warning
from them?</p>

<p>John Russell made his appearance in the House on
Friday, but as they were not to divide he did not stay.
Wilson (of the 'Economist') made a very fine speech; Disraeli
very amusing, and Gladstone very good. It was a great
night for Free Trade, which Wilson and Gladstone vindicated
with great ability. The Government have been sadly vexed
at an article in the 'Times' on Friday, speaking of them,
and Lord John especially, very contemptuously. The truth
is, the 'Times' thinks it has sniffed out that they cannot go
on, and wants, according to its custom, to give them a shove;
but matters are not ripe for a change yet, nor anything like
it. It is evident that the notion of the weakness and incapacity
of the Government is spreading far and wide, and
nothing can exceed Charles Wood's unpopularity, nor is any
confidence felt in Lord John himself. Palmerston is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
most in favour at this moment; he has done well and gained
some credit. Peel still holds the same language about not
taking office, and treats it as a thing that is quite out of the
question; but his friends see well enough that matters are
moving on to this inevitable consummation.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 14th.</i>&mdash;The Government had a capital division last
night, and Lord John made a very good and stout speech.
In France everything is going down hill at railroad pace.
This fine Revolution, which may be termed the madness of
a few for the ruin of many, is already making the French
people weep tears of blood. Hitherto there has been little
or no violence, and fine professions of justice and philanthropy;
up to this time, not a month from the beginning,
the account may be thus balanced: they have got rid of a
King and a Royal Family and the cost thereof; they have
got a reform so radical and complete, that it can go no
further; they have repealed some laws and some taxes which
were obnoxious to different persons or different classes, but
none of which were grievous or sensibly injurious to the
nation at large. In short, it is difficult to point out any
considerable advantage either of a positive or a negative
character which they have obtained, or have got the prospect
of obtaining. However, it remains to be seen whether they
can work out any advantage from their new institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the other side of the account presents some
formidable items for a political balance sheet. They have
got a Government composed of men who have not the slightest
idea how to govern, albeit they are men of energy, activity,
and some capacity. The country is full of fear and distrust.
Ruin and bankruptcy are stalking through the streets of
the capital. The old revolutionary principles and expedients
are more and more drawn forth and displayed by the present
rulers; they are assuming despotic power, and using it without
scruple; they confer it on their agents; they proclaim
social and political maxims fraught with ruin and desolation,
and incompatible with the existence of any Government.
The different Ministers vie with one another in the extravagance
of their several manifestoes. Louis Blanc holds a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
parliament of operatives, whom he feeds with soft sawder
and delusive expectations, giving them for political
truths all the most dangerous absurdities of his book.
Garnier Pagès, in his frank <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="presentation">exposé</i> of the finances of the
country, approaches to the very verge of national bankruptcy,
and is evidently prepared for the next step. Carnot instructs
the people to elect for their representatives (who are to be
the unchecked masters of the Empire), not men of property
and education, but any men who have republican ideas; and
Ledru Rollin desires his agents to act in the same spirit, and
with all the authority (which means despotism) that a revolutionary
government always assumes it to be its right to
exercise. In short, all is terror, distress, and misery, both
material and moral; everybody fleeing away from the turbulent
capital, and hiding what money he can collect; funds
falling, everything depreciated in value, the shops unfrequented,
no buyers, tranquillity still doubtfully preserved by
factitious means, but the duration of which no one counts
upon. As the embarrassment and suffering increase, so will
the clouds continue to gather, and at last the storm will
burst&mdash;but how, when, and where, with what fury, whom it
will spare, or whom sweep away, none can venture to predict.
Such, however, is the state of the capital, the heart of everything;
while the provinces are motionless, and seem to wait
with patient resignation the unfolding of events. All the
letters that arrive here, whether they come from Legitimists,
or Liberals, or Orleanists, or indifferents to all parties, tell
the same tale of disgust, distress, and dread.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 16th.</i>&mdash;I dined with Madame de Lieven <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="face-to-face">tête-à-tête</i>
the day before yesterday. Our talk, of course, was almost
entirely about French affairs. I asked her whether she
thought, as many here do, that if the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riot">émeute</i> had been put
down by violence, the throne must have fallen, as the King
could not have reigned in the midst of bloodshed. She said
the Ministers would have gone out, but the throne would
have been safe. She told me Guizot was not indisposed to
give some <i>parliamentary</i> reform (not electoral), and was
sensible that the great number of functionaries in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Chamber was shocking to public opinion. He proposed to
begin with his own department, and render all diplomatic
agents incapable of sitting&mdash;a very small concession! She
said something to me (as Lord Campbell did) about writing
memoirs, and that my curious position&mdash;so intimate with so
many persons of all parties and descriptions, and being so
much in the confidence of all&mdash;gave me peculiar advantages
for doing so. She knew I had written Journals, and I told
her it was so, but in a very loose and casual way, and I asked
her if she had not written. She said, 'Beaucoup.'</p>

<p>Lord John Russell had a great success the other night,
and his speech got many votes. It was one of the best he
ever made, and in all respects judicious and becoming his
position.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 20th.</i>&mdash;There has been all sorts of botheration
about Louis Philippe and his affairs, particularly about his
remaining at Claremont. Soon after he came, a notification
was made to him <i>by Palmerston</i> that he was not to remain
there permanently.<a href="#Footnote_40" id="FNanchor_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
He complained of this to all the people
he saw (talking very loosely and foolishly), and it got wind
and made a noise. Soon after, the Duke of Wellington went
to see him, and told him that Claremont was the fit place for
him, and the other day a letter arrived from Leopold telling
him he might stay there as long as he liked; he is therefore
to stay. So many different versions have been put forth of
the details of what passed concerning this matter, that it is
next to impossible to ascertain the exact truth. Everything
in France gets more serious and alarming every day. The
clubs of Paris are omnipotent, the National Guards are
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="crushed">écrasés</i>, the Provisional Government makes a show of independence,
and Lamartine makes fine speeches; but they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
at the mercy of the Parisian mob, whose organisation is wonderful.
The playing out of the game will be very curious.
At present, this mob of the capital seems resolved to dictate
to the provinces, and to set aside the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVOLUTIONS EVERYWHERE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 25th.</i>&mdash;Nothing is more extraordinary than to look
back at my last date and see what has happened in the
course of <i>five days</i>. A tenth part of any one of the events
would have lasted us for as many months, with sentiments
of wonder and deep interest; but now we are perplexed,
overwhelmed, and carried away with excitement,
and the most stupendous events are become like matters
of every-day occurrence. Within these last four or five
days there has been a desperate battle in the streets of
Berlin between the soldiers and the mob; the flight of the
Prince of Prussia; the King's convocation of his States;
concessions to and reconciliation with his people; and his
invitation to all Germany to form a Federal State; and his
notification of what is tantamount to removing the Imperial
Crown from the head of the wretched <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crétin</i> at Vienna, and
placing it on his own.</p>

<p>Next, a revolution in Austria; an <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riot">émeute</i> at Vienna;
downfall and flight of Metternich, and announcement of
a constitutional <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>; <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riots">émeutes</i> at Milan; expulsion of
Austrians, and Milanese independence; Hungary up and
doing, and the whole empire in a state of dissolution.
Throughout Germany all the people stirring; all the sovereigns
yielding to the popular demands; the King of Hanover
submitting to the terms demanded of him; the King
of Bavaria abdicating; many minor occurrences, any one of
which in ordinary times would have been full of interest and
importance, passing almost unheeded. To attempt to describe
historically and narratively these events as they occur
would be impossible if I were to attempt it; and it is unnecessary,
because they are chronicled in a thousand publications,
from which time and enquiry will winnow out the
falsehoods, and leave a connected, intelligible, and tolerably
accurate story. It is only therefore left to me to save some
small fragments of facts or sentiments which would otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
be swept down the stream and lost for ever, whenever
such come across me.</p>

<p>France marches on with giant strides to confusion and
ruin; Germany looks better; and there still appear to be
some influences whose strength and authority are unimpaired,
and the passion for reconstituting a German nationality
may still save her from anarchy. It is very surprising
that as yet in no country have single master-minds started
forward to ride on these whirlwinds and direct the storms.
In the midst of the roar of the revolutionary waters that
are deluging the whole earth, it is grand to see how we
stand erect and unscathed. It is the finest tribute that ever
has been paid to our Constitution, the greatest test that ever
has been applied to it, and there is a general feeling of confidence,
and a reliance on the soundness of the public mind,
though not unmixed with those doubts and apprehensions
which the calmest and the most courageous may feel in the
midst of such stupendous phenomena as those which surround
us.</p>

<p>Our most difficult task is to deal with Irish disaffection
and Irish distress: the former has never been so bold, reckless,
and insolent. Clarendon, after enduring much and
allowing the agitators to go on unchecked, at last attacked
them in the persons of O'Brien, Mitchell, and Meagher.
The general opinion here was that they were not worth
attacking, and were so contemptible, and had so entirely
failed to work upon the people, that they might be let alone;
but he judged otherwise, and there is a great disposition to
defer to his judgement. No sooner had they been held to
bail, than others of the same party not only renewed the
seditious language the first had used, but broke out with
far greater fury and indecency; in plain language, they
called on the people to arm for the purpose of overturning
the Constitution, and they said they would have no more
kings or queens. I thought this must amount to high
treason; but George Grey told me yesterday that the lawyers
here hold that to make it treason it must be followed by
some overt act. However, whether Clarendon was right or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
wrong in attacking the rebel Repealers, it is clear that he
ought now to throw away the scabbard, and war having
been declared to wage it vigorously and unflinchingly. The
confidence in him is unbounded, both there and here. It is
a good feature in the case that the Roman Catholic clergy
have on the whole behaved exceedingly well, and Clarendon
has written to Lord John Russell that something must be
done for them; but the difficulties of doing this something
are next to insurmountable. No amount of danger, no
policy however urgent, no considerations of justice, are sufficient
to overcome the testimony and bigotry of the people of
England and Scotland on this question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON'S DINNER TO M. GUIZOT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 26th.</i>&mdash;I dined yesterday with Palmerston to meet
Guizot and Madame de Lieven! Strange dinner, when I
think of the sentiments towards each other of the two
Ministers, and of all that Guizot said to me when I was at
Paris last year! However, it did all very well. I thought
Palmerston and Guizot would have shaken each other's arms
off, and nothing could exceed the cordiality or apparent ease
with which they conversed. There was not the slightest
symptom of embarrassment; and though Guizot's manner
is always stiff, pedantic, and without the least approach to
<i>abandon</i>, he seemed to me to exhibit less of these defects
than usual. There were the Granvilles, Clanricardes, and
Harry Vane; Temple, Holland, and Beauvale came in the
evening. I am glad Palmerston asked him to dinner, especially
after what passed in reference to <i>the exiles</i>, and the
impertinent remonstrances from Paris.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 31st.</i>&mdash;Nothing new these last few days; Ireland
getting more and more serious, and a strong opinion gaining
ground that there will be an outbreak and fighting, and that
this will be on the whole a good thing, inasmuch as nothing
will tame the Irish agitators but a severe drubbing. Last
night I met M. Delessert<a href="#Footnote_41" id="FNanchor_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
at dinner; he talked of the recent
events in France and the state of the country; hopeless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
about the latter, and gave a character of his countrymen
which he said he was ashamed to give, but it was the truth.
He said they were not to be governed, for they had no sense
of religion or of morality, or any probity among them; he
said he had been faithful to the Government to the last, and
it did not become him now to speak against Guizot and his
policy, but that his unpopularity was immense, and he had
committed the great fault of staying in power in spite of it
and for so many years, when the French could not bear anything
that lasted long; he was always aware of the fatal
mistake Guizot had made about the Spanish marriages, and
the consequences of the rupture of the English alliance;
and he said Duchâtel was of the same mind as himself, and
had communicated to him the conversation I had had with
him when I was in Paris, and all I had said on the subject.
I was not aware before that I was <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="preaching to the converted">prêchant un converti</i> so
entirely, though I suspected it. Delane told me yesterday
that Leopold saw their correspondent the other day, and
asked him if England would give him a subsidy to assist in
repelling the French and Belgian republicans who threaten
his territory; and Van de Weyer told him they were in a
great dilemma, as the French Government were letting loose
these ruffians upon them, affording them all sorts of assistance
underhand; and if the Belgian Government repelled
them, it was very likely the mob and clubs at Paris would
compel the Provisional Government to support them and
swallow up Belgium. Everybody now thinks there must
be a war somewhere, out of such immense confusion and
excitement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FALL OF METTERNICH.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;There is nothing to record but odds and
ends: no new revolution, no fresh deposition. Madame de
Lieven told me yesterday what she had heard from Flahault
of the outbreak at Vienna and the downfall of Metternich.
When the people rose and demanded liberal measures, they
were informed that the Council would be convened and deliberate,
and an answer should be given them in two hours.
The Council assembled, consisting of the Ministers and the
Archdukes. The question was stated, when Metternich rose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
and harangued them for an hour and a half without their
appearing nearly to approach a close. On this the Archduke
John pulled out his watch and said, 'Prince, in half an hour
we must give an answer to the people, and we have not yet
begun to consider what we shall say to them.' On this
Kolowrath said, 'Sir, I have sat in Council with Prince
Metternich for twenty-five years, and it has always been his
habit to speak thus without coming to the point.' 'But,'
said the Archduke, 'we must come to the point, and that
without delay. Are you aware, Prince,' turning to Metternich,
'that the first of the people's demands is that you
should resign?' Metternich said that he had promised the
Emperor Francis on his deathbed never to desert his son,
the present Emperor, nor would he. They intimated that
his remaining would be difficult. Oh, he said, if the Imperial
Family wished him to resign, he should feel that he
was released from his engagement, and he was ready to yield
to their wishes. They said they did wish it, and he instantly
acquiesced. Then the Emperor himself interposed and said,
'But, after all, I am the Emperor, and it is for me to decide;
and I yield everything. Tell the people I consent to all their
demands.' And thus <i>the Crétin</i> settled it all; and the great
Minister, who was in his own person considered as <i>the
Empire</i>, and had governed despotically for forty years, slunk
away, and to this hour nobody knows where he is concealed.
But in this general break-up of the Austrian Monarchy there
seems still some vitality left in it, and we hear that those
provinces which demand liberal governments do not want to
get rid of the dynasty; and in the midst of the confusion
there is no small jealousy of the King of Prussia, and disgust
at his attempt to make himself <i>Sovereign of Germany</i>.
The condition of Prussia is disquieting; and the King, who
has acted a part at once wavering and selfish, has raised up
a host of enemies against his pretensions.</p>

<p>There has been, however, something of a pause on the
Continent for some days, which gives us leisure to look inwards
and consider our own situation. We are undisturbed
in the midst of the universal hubbub, and the surface of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
society looks smooth and safe: nevertheless there is plenty
of cause for serious reflexion and apprehension. It is the
fashion to say that this country is sound; that the newfangled
theories which are turning continental brains find
no acceptance here; but the outward manifestations are not
entirely to be relied upon. Ireland never was in so dangerous
a state; not the less so because the Repealers and
Republicans are so mad or so wicked, and the masses so ungrateful
and stupid. It is in vain that we prove to demonstration
that the Irish would gain nothing by separation
from England, and that we point to our superhuman exertions
in the famine as a proof of our good feeling. Our
remonstrances and the violent appeals of the Irish leaders
are addressed to vast masses who, in spite of all we have
done for them, are in the lowest state of misery and starvation;
it is not surprising that millions who are in this state
should listen to the pernicious orators who promise to better
their condition by the Repeal of the Union and the overthrow
of English power. When men are so low and miserable
that they cannot be worse off, and they see no prospect
of being better off under the existing state of things; when
they are ignorant and excitable, and continually acted upon
by every sort of mischievous influence, it would be strange
indeed if they were not as turbulent and disaffected as we
find them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OBSTRUCTION IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>April 5th.</i>&mdash;I broke off the other day, and now resume.
Lord John Russell, in reply to a question put by Jocelyn to
him in the House of Commons, said the Government would
come to Parliament for powers as soon as they deemed it
necessary, and gave him to understand that they were preparing
measures, but declined to say what. His answer did
not give satisfaction. Everybody here wants something to
be done to stop this torrent of sedition. I saw Graham this
morning for a short time; he is greatly alarmed at the
aspect of affairs both at home and abroad; he thinks the
temper of the masses here very serious. The Chartist meeting
on Monday next makes him uneasy, and he has talked
much to George Grey and the Speaker about precautions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
The state of the law is very doubtful, and it is a nice question
whether to prevent a procession to the House of Commons
or not. The expressions of the Act about seditious assemblies
are ambiguous. Then he strongly deprecates the
Queen's going out of town on Saturday, which he thinks
will look like cowardice in her personally, and as indicative
of a sense of danger which ought not to be manifested. I
advised him (and Peel, who thinks so likewise) to tell the
Government this; he said Peel would tell the Prince. He
spoke very bitterly of Lord John Russell's having allowed
the Irish Arms Bill to expire, and showed me his speech in
which he engaged, if necessary, to come down and ask for
fresh powers. I said, 'Why don't they come now?' He
said it would be very difficult now; that the forms of the
House, which enabled anybody to obstruct, would infallibly
be seized on, and no Bill allowed to pass; every sort of delay
would be interposed. I said, 'They ought not to endure
this, and should suspend the Standing Orders.'</p>

<p class="entry"><i>J. G.</i>&mdash;How was this to be done? They would never
allow the question to be put.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>C. G.</i>&mdash;Surely the House of Commons never will allow
itself to be turned into a Polish Diet with a <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="free veto">liberum veto</i> to
any man who chose to obstruct the business of the country.
If there is no other way, it will be a time for the Speaker to
interfere; he alone can do it; refuse to put the question of
adjournment, and cast himself on the House for support. A
brave Speaker will do this.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>J. G.</i>&mdash;This is a very serious matter: our forms are admirable,
and with gentlemen are everything that is useful
and desirable. If once you set them aside, all freedom of
debate will be gone, and from such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> there would
be an appeal out of doors.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>C. G.</i>&mdash;The appeal would not be successful in such a
case; the English abhor the Irish and their proceedings,
and will never endure that the House of Commons shall be
dictated to by Irish Repealers and agitators.</p>

<p>Here somebody came in, and we were obliged to leave off.</p>

<p>The reply of Lamartine to the Irish deputation, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
has been so anxiously expected, came yesterday, and excellent
it was. He gave a lecture to the Irish much stronger
than any they have had here; and if his speech does no good,
it will certainly do no harm. There is now an increasing
opinion that the French will be driven to go to war somewhere
as a relief from the intolerable distress in which the
country will soon be plunged. Beggary and anarchy are
striding on at a fearful rate, and the present bloodless but
most agitated and frightened state will in all probability
soon be changed into scenes of violence brought about by
the ferocity of every kind of unchained passion.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 6th.</i>&mdash;Ireland now absorbs all other interests. I
saw Grey yesterday, who told me they did not mean to do
anything till after Monday next, but then they would. It
has not yet been determined whether they should stop the
Chartists from entering London or not, but a Cabinet was
to be held to decide the matter to-day.<a href="#Footnote_42" id="FNanchor_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> He thought they
should prevent their crossing the bridges. I saw the Duke
in the morning at Apsley House in a prodigious state of
excitement; said he had plenty of troops, and would answer
for keeping everything quiet if the Government would only
be firm and vigorous, and announce by a proclamation that
the mob should not be permitted to occupy the town. He
wanted to prevent <i>groups</i> from going into the Park and
assembling there, but this would be impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR ROBERT PEEL ON OBSTRUCTION.</div>

<p>This morning I had another conversation with Graham.
He told me he sat next to Hobhouse at Hardinge's dinner<a href="#Footnote_43" id="FNanchor_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> at
the India House last night, and had much very open talk
with him. He understood from Hobhouse that Government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
did not intend to do anything, and he told him that he was
afraid that they would find great difficulty in surmounting
the obstacles that the forms of the House would enable the
Opposition to throw in their way. Subsequently, however,
he had a conversation with Peel, who he found took a very
different view of the matter, and the same that I do. He
said that the Government ought to act as if they had no
doubt of obtaining all they required from Parliament; to
consider well what that was; to choose their time, not delaying
it long, and then to have a call of the House and ask
for all the powers they require. If they find themselves
thwarted by a minority moving successive adjournments, to
sit there for any number of hours; to divide twenty or thirty
times; and at last, when they had sufficiently proved to the
country that their efforts were vain, and that they had exhausted
all legitimate means, to give up the contest, instantly
hold a Cabinet, and then a Council, by which they should
do by Order in Council what they wished to do by Act of
Parliament, and trust to public opinion and Parliament to
support and sanction their proceedings. He told me he had
expressed to Hobhouse the strong opinion he has of the inexpediency,
even the danger, of the Queen's quitting town
at this juncture, and that if these strong measures are to be
adopted, her presence would of course be indispensable. The
Speaker told him that an Act of Parliament was not necessary,
as by an old Act (21 &amp; 22 George III.) the Lord Lieutenant
could in case of rebellion (of the existence of which
he was himself the judge) proclaim martial law and suspend
the Habeas Corpus; but Peel is against having recourse to
such a measure, and prefers the application to Parliament.
He thinks, too, that if the Government do not soon adopt
such a course, they will be incurring a responsibility far
more fearful than any they can incur by its adoption&mdash;the
responsibility of all the blood that will be shed and the mischief
that will ensue. Graham again spoke of John Russell's
conduct in giving up the Arms Act, and said that he had
so great a regard for him that he would not say one word
against him on that score; but that he must expect to hear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
of it in case of extremities, and that he would be called to
a severe account if there should be an outbreak, and if torrents
of blood were shed by the instrumentality of those arms
which but for him would not have been put into every man's
hands. In my conversation with Grey yesterday, he told
me that the Church question must be brought forward&mdash;not
now, because the moment of rebellion and armed resistance
was not that in which it would be wise or dignified or right
to make concessions and introduce remedial measures; but
that when peace was restored, and in another year, this
great question must be faced and dealt with; the details,
however, it is no use as yet to enter into.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 9th.</i>&mdash;After I had seen Graham the other morning,
I thought it of such importance that John Russell should
know what he and Peel thought, that I went to him and
told him. He received me with one of his coldest and
most offensive manners, said nothing, and did not vouchsafe
to tell me that they had made up their minds to do something,
and that Grey was going to give notice of a Bill
in a few minutes from that time. Nothing could be more
ungracious, and I mentally resolved never to go near him
again to tell him anything of use to him. I wrote to the
Duke of Bedford and told him all this; and he wrote me
back word that he was not surprised, and that nobody
had more to suffer from John's manner than he himself;
that John is very obstinate and unmanageable, and does not
like to be found fault with or told things which run counter
to his own ideas&mdash;all which he owned was very unfortunate,
and a grievous fault in his character.</p>

<p>All London is making preparations to encounter a Chartist
row to-morrow: so much that it is either very sublime
or very ridiculous. All the clerks and others in the different
offices are ordered to be sworn in special constables, and to
constitute themselves into garrisons. I went to the police
office with all my clerks, messengers, &amp;c., and we were all
sworn. We are to pass the whole day at the office to-morrow,
and I am to send down all my guns; in short, we
are to take a warlike attitude.  Colonel Harness, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Railway Department, is our commander-in-chief; every
gentleman in London is become a constable, and there
is an organisation of some sort in every district.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHARTIST MOVEMENT IN LONDON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Newmarket, April 13th.</i>&mdash;Monday passed off with surprising
quiet, and it was considered a most satisfactory
demonstration on the part of the Government, and the
peaceable and loyal part of the community. Enormous preparations
were made, and a host of military, police, and
special constables were ready if wanted; every gentleman
in London was sworn, and during a great part of the day,
while the police were reposing, they did duty. The Chartist
movement was contemptible; but everybody rejoices
that the defensive demonstration was made, for it has
given a great and memorable lesson which will not be
thrown away, either on the disaffected and mischievous, or
the loyal and peaceful; and it will produce a vast effect in
all foreign countries, and show how solid is the foundation
on which we are resting. We have displayed a great resolution
and a great strength, and given unmistakable
proofs, that if sedition and rebellion hold up their heads
in this country, they will be instantly met with the most
vigorous resistance, and be put down by the band of authority,
and by the zealous co-operation of all classes of the
people. The whole of the Chartist movement was to the
last degree contemptible from first to last. The delegates
who met on the eve of the day were full of valour amounting
to desperation; they indignantly rejected the intimation
of the Government that their procession would not be
allowed; swore they would have it at all hazard, and die, if
necessary, in asserting their rights. One man said he loved
his life, his wife, his children, but would sacrifice all rather
than give way.</p>

<p>In the morning (a very fine day) everybody was on the
alert; the parks were closed; our office was fortified, a
barricade of Council Registers was erected in the accessible
room on the ground-floor, and all our guns were taken down
to be used in defence of the building. However, at about
twelve o'clock crowds came streaming along Whitehall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
going northwards, and it was announced that all was over.
The intended tragedy was rapidly changed into a ludicrous
farce. The Chartists, about 20,000 in number, assembled
on Kennington Common. Presently Mr. Mayne appeared on
the ground, and sent one of his inspectors to say he wanted to
speak to Feargus O'Connor. Feargus thought he was going
to be arrested and was in a terrible fright; but he went to
Mayne, who merely said he was desired to inform him that
the meeting would not be interfered with, but the procession
would not be allowed. Feargus insisted on shaking
hands with Mayne, swore he was his best of friends, and
instantly harangued his rabble, advising them not to provoke
a collision, and to go away quietly&mdash;advice they instantly
obeyed, and with great alacrity and good-humour.
Thus all evaporated in smoke. Feargus himself then repaired
to the Home Office, saw Sir George Grey, and told him it
was all over, and thanked the Government for their leniency,
assuring him the Convention would not have been so
lenient if they had got the upper hand. Grey asked him
if he was going back to the meeting. He said No; that he
had had his toes trodden on till he was lame, and his pocket
picked, and he would have no more to do with it. The
petition was brought down piecemeal and presented in the
afternoon. Since that there has been an exposure of the
petition itself, covering the authors of it with ridicule and
disgrace. It turns out to be signed by less than two
millions, instead of by six as Feargus stated; and of those,
there were no end of fictitious names, together with the
insertion of every species of ribaldry, indecency, and impertinence.
The Chartists are very crestfallen, and evidently
conscious of the contemptible figure they cut; but
they have endeavoured to bluster and lie as well as they
can in their subsequent gatherings, and talk of other petitions
and meetings, which nobody cares about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLANS FOR IRELAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, April 15th.</i>&mdash;Every account from every quarter
proves the wonderful effect produced by the event of Monday
last. Normanby writes me word that it has astonished
and disappointed the French more than they care to admit;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
and it has evidently had a great effect in Ireland, where
Smith O'Brien is gone back in doleful dumps at his rebuff
at Paris, and his reception in the House of Commons.
Clarendon writes word that if there is any outbreak, which
he now doubts, it will probably be after a great tea-party
they were about to have on Smith O'Brien's return. The
Government have gained some credit and some strength by
this affair, as well as by their (at last) bringing fresh measures
of a protective character into Parliament. The Conservatives
are very angry with them for giving way on the
clause about 'words spoken,' in the new Bill, and for consenting
to make it temporary. Graham told me he had
great doubts about that clause, but he would support whatever
they proposed. It is certainly true that their concessions
are not well managed; they do not come down and
make them as if on mature consideration; but they suffer
themselves to be bullied out of them by their Radical opponents,
and this gives them an air of vacillation and irresolution
which is very prejudicial. Lord John made a very
good speech on this Bill, and George Grey by common consent
does his work very well indeed.</p>

<p>I had some talk with the Duke of Bedford at Newmarket
about Ireland, and told him my plan of operations,
that is, the idea that has presented itself to my mind. It
consists of two parts&mdash;one as to the land, the other the
Church. I propose that the Government should become a
great proprietor and capitalist, raising whatever funds are
necessary, and expending them in productive works and the
employment of labour. I have observed that all who have
written, spoken, or thought on this subject, agree that the
indispensable thing for Ireland is the application of capital
to the developement of the resources of the country and the
employment of its people. Nobody will invest capital there
in its present state; consequently those resources remain
undeveloped, and the people are in a state of idleness and
starvation; that which it is desirable that everybody should
do, but which nobody will do, must be done by the Government
itself. I have only as yet formed the idea, without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
having deeply considered it, still less attempted to work
out its details. The other question, the Church, that
eternal stumbling-block, does not present less difficulty,
but is equally urgent. This morning the Duke of Bedford
came here and told me he had spoken to Lord John
about my ideas, but without going into any detail, or even
explanation, and Lord John said he should like to talk to
me about it himself; he said, moreover, that they not only
mean to propose something about the Church, but have
got a plan half prepared. They will not, however, attempt
to bring anything forward this year, and they would be very
wrong if they did.</p>

<p>There has just appeared in all the newspapers a long
letter of Louis Philippe's to the Queen of the Belgians,
giving his whole case about the Montpensier marriage, with
certain other letters from Guizot and Salvandy on the same
subject. These papers were found at the Tuileries, and have
been published at Paris. The history of this letter is this.
When the King had concocted the marriage he made his
Queen write to ours, and after mentioning all his family by
name, and telling her all they were severally about, she
mentioned this marriage in the same casual way, as a happy
event in the family. Our Queen wrote an answer, in which
she expressed her satisfaction at the happiness and prosperity
of the different members of her family whom Queen
Marie Amélie had enumerated, excepting the last topic, that
of the marriage. This she said was a <i>political</i> matter, on
which she entertained very different sentiments. It was
then that Louis Philippe wrote this long epistle which the
Queen of the Belgians sent to our Queen, who wrote a very
laconic reply, saying that it had not altered her opinion, and
that she considered that the King had forfeited the word he
had given her. These letters she showed to Lord John
Russell and Palmerston. The King was furious, and from
that moment no more communication took place between
them till the letter the Queen wrote to him (or to Queen
Marie Amélie) on the death of Madame Adélaïde. The
Duchess of Gloucester sent the Duchess of Bedford a letter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of the Queen's to her on the present state of affairs and
her own situation, which exhibits her in a very amiable
light. She talks with such sympathy of the sufferings of
others in whom she is interested, and with such thankfulness
for the many blessings which she herself enjoys, and
which she says she almost 'grudges' when she looks round
and sees the afflictions of so many whom she loves. The
expression is faulty, but the idea is clear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR HENRY BULWER'S EXPULSION FROM MADRID.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>April 30th.</i>&mdash;While I was at Newmarket the newspapers
published the correspondence between Palmerston, Bulwer,
and Sotomayor, which excited great interest and no small
animadversion even there.<a href="#Footnote_44" id="FNanchor_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> It was a choice specimen of
Palmerston's spirit of domination, which, so far from being
moderated by all that was said about his Greek correspondence,
seems only to have broken out with fresh virulence on
this occasion. It remains to be seen whether John Russell
and his colleagues will once for all make a stand against
his arbitrary and independent administration of the Foreign
Office, or submit to it: this must be the crisis. The Duke
of Bedford told me he had read it in the papers with much
annoyance, because he foresaw the difficulties it would produce;
that he had known of it some time ago, and of what
had occurred relating to it; that Palmerston had shown
John Russell the despatch, and that Lord John had objected
to it, stating his reasons for so doing. According to his
custom, Palmerston made no reply; but they parted, Lord
John naturally concluding that after he had stated his
objection the despatch would not be sent. Shortly after he
was with the Queen, and in conversation on this subject he
told her what had passed between Palmerston and himself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and what he had said. 'No; did you say all that?' said
the Queen. He said, 'Yes.' 'Well then,' she replied, 'it
produced no effect, for the despatch is gone. Lord Palmerston
sent it to me; I know it is gone.' What more
passed I do not know. The only difference Palmerston
made was that he divided his despatch to Bulwer into two,
but he did not omit or alter a word of what Lord John had
objected to. When I first heard this my impression was
that this was such a daring defiance of the Prime Minister
and such an insulting indifference to the sentiments of his
colleagues that it must lead to a quarrel, and that Palmerston
would be forced to resign. I anticipated discussions in both
Houses of Parliament, in which Palmerston's colleagues
would be obliged to speak out, especially John Russell, and
that they would throw him over, which if they did it would
be impossible for him to stay in. Lord Stanley, who was at
Newmarket all last week, told the Duke of Bedford that it
was very much against his inclination to attack Palmerston,
who was so good-natured and agreeable, but that it was
impossible to pass this over. Still on consideration I suspect
that Palmerston's audacity and good fortune, his rare
dexterity, and total absence of sensitiveness will carry him
through. They will probably knock under to him, they will
not venture to throw him over in public, and will content
themselves with some timid remonstrance in private, which
he will receive with perfect good humour and treat with
sovereign contempt. He has not evinced the slightest
disposition to give way, for I heard yesterday that he has
written to Bulwer fully approving of his letter. He has
replied to Sotomayor in a tone of sarcasm, and he has taken
this opportunity to make Bulwer K.C.B. Of course he
will not hear of recalling him, and I begin to think that it
will end in his dictating to everybody, Spanish Cabinet and
his own colleagues, and he will march on triumphant in
the midst of ineffectual grumblings and abortive efforts to
restrain him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CLARENDON ON IRISH CATHOLICS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 3rd.</i>&mdash;Palmerston and John Russell seem to have
made up this matter (if ever they quarrelled about it, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
they probably did not), for I hear of Lord John expressing
joy that it is taken up by Urquhart in the House of Commons
rather than by any more formidable opponent. Ben
Stanley tells me that it is all Bulwer's fault, and that he
was instructed only to interfere if a suitable opportunity
presented itself, and then verbally; but as Palmerston will
not throw over Bulwer, it is an <i>imbroglio</i>, and will make a
bother; but it is clear that Palmerston is in no danger. Ben
Stanley also says that the Spanish Government are very
anxious to make it up; however, we shall have something
elicited by the discussions.</p>

<p>I had a long letter from Clarendon yesterday, and saw
Southern<a href="#Footnote_45" id="FNanchor_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
 in the morning, just come from Dublin, where he
has been staying several weeks. The former wrote to me
on the subject of the Irish Church, and says that he is all
against touching it, for that the Protestants are now the sole
link between the two countries, and that they from feelings
of pride and old associations cling to that Establishment
with unconquerable tenacity, and any attempt to invade it
would alienate the whole Protestant body and render them
repealers also. He writes at considerable length on this
topic, and what he says may be true; but if it be, and if it
is always to be acted on, peace never can be attainable.
Southern says everything is better so far as the chance of
any immediate outbreak is removed, but that the state of
the country is not improved, and that the chronic agitation
and disaffection will only go on the more in every district
under the priests. Clarendon says not a Roman Catholic in
Ireland is to be trusted, and gives a deplorable picture of
the condition of landed property and proprietors; the inveterate
habit of selfishness and indifference to the state of
the masses, which has so long distinguished the landowners,
makes it impossible to get them to act on the principles
which regulate the relations of landlord and tenant here;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
and he assures me that there are many who contemplate in
the most cold-blooded way the relief from a starving and
redundant population by the operation of famine. Then
the tricks and jobbing of those who are concerned in the
administration of the poor laws produce infinite mischief,
and in short the whole material, high and low, is so corrupt
that it is an Herculean task for anybody to introduce order
into such a chaos, and to try and weed out its manifold
evils. He complains that his plans and schemes for employing
the people and developing the national resources
do not meet with the attention he has a right to expect
from the Government, and he doubts if Lord John Russell
comprehends, or even reads them.</p>

<p>Yesterday arrived the news of Smith O'Brien's affair at
Limerick,<a href="#Footnote_46" id="FNanchor_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
which was hailed with great satisfaction. Ever
since the Bill passed there has been a manifest falling off
in the violence and determination of the Patriots; they have
quailed under the force of Government, and nothing can be
more paltry than the figure they are now cutting compared
with their boastings and menaces the other day. Mitchell,
Meagher, and O'Brien were near being killed at Limerick
by an O'Connellite mob, and were saved by the interposition
of the Queen's troops. Smith O'Brien was severely beaten,
and has renounced the country, and says he will retire into
private life. Mitchell, who meant to meet the law and the
Government face to face, and dared them to the fight, has
recourse to every sort of chicanery, and avails himself of all
the technical pleas he can find to delay his trial. All these
things have drawn both ridicule and contempt on these
empty boasters, who began by blustering and swaggering,
and who now crouch under the blows that are aimed at
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CENSURE OF SIR HENRY BULWER.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 7th.</i>&mdash;The Limerick affair and discomfiture of the
Young Irelanders has given a great blow to the whole rebellious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
faction, put Clarendon in spirits, and for the time
cleared the horizon, and dispelled all chance of disturbance
or outbreak. People jump to the conclusion (and the
press takes that line) that the agitation is entirely at an
end, and Ireland about to become peaceable if not satisfied.
I have had a letter from Bessborough,<a href="#Footnote_47" id="FNanchor_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> who tells me what
Clarendon and Crampton said to him about Catholic endowment,
and of the impossibility of it. The latter, he says,
mixes with people of every denomination and description,
and his opinion upon it he thinks entitled to much attention.
Bessborough also thinks everything is looking better in
Ireland, and more promising for future prosperity and tranquillity;
he anticipates, in short, a very prosperous year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile everything is improving here. Within the
last week there is a manifest revival of trade both in Lancashire
and Yorkshire, and the magnificent weather which has
succeeded the long course of rain and cold promises as good
a harvest as the farmers can desire.</p>

<p>On Friday evening Stanley made his attack on Palmerston
in a very brilliant speech, which Guizot was there to
hear. He made a strong case, and Lord Lansdowne a very
weak defence, and that only by throwing over Bulwer, and
casting the blame on him. It will all end in nothing, as
usual, and Palmerston will not care a straw. It is, however,
damaging, for everybody thinks that he has been flippant,
and that there was neither motive nor occasion for his interferences,
or that it has been well done if there had been. In
short, it is an ill-judged unskilfully conducted proceeding.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>May 9th.</i>&mdash;Palmerston got another drubbing last night
in the Lords, which will be a lesson to him, if anything can.
Stanley made a second speech, still more effective than his
first, and Aberdeen followed him. Lord Lansdowne was
miserably feeble in reply, as he might well be, having no
case. I never saw public opinion more strongly or generally
pronounced, and it may be of use in moderating Palmerston
for the future. If he were not the man he is, there would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
no doubt of it, but he is apparently incurable. The whole
affair is very discreditable to the Government. It looks bad
enough as it is; but what would people think of it if they knew
that Lord John Russell had seen these offensive despatches,
had objected to them, and that they had gone in spite of
him; and now he and his colleagues are obliged to come
down to Parliament and to defend them?</p>

<p class="entry"><i>May 13th.</i>&mdash;Palmerston's affair has not failed to produce
certain consequences. Lord Lansdowne was in a state of
great indignation and disgust; he told the Duke of Bedford
he never had in all his life been placed in such a situation,
that he had not cared for Stanley's first speech, but that when
he made his second, he was conscious he had not a word to
say. He had never read the despatches, and had not a notion
how far Palmerston had committed himself in approval of
Bulwer. He said that he had been to Lord John and told him
this must never happen again, and it was arranged between
them (he little knows how vainly) that for the future Lord
John at least should see Palmerston's despatches before
they go. Hobhouse spoke to me about it, and in reply to
my remarks saying how unfair it was to place such a man as
Lord Lansdowne in such a position, he very comically said,
'I wish <i>you</i> would say all this to Palmerston.' This was too
good a joke, as I told him, that he a Cabinet Minister, his
colleague and sharing his responsibility, could not tell him
his mind, and should ask me to tell Palmerston the truths
it behoved him to know. Both Labouchere and Charles
Wood also spoke to me about it. I said to the latter,
'<i>Unless Palmerston is quite incorrigible</i> all this will be a lesson
to him, and restrain him for the future.' He replied, 'You
are quite right to put in that proviso.' Such is the state of
things in this Cabinet.</p>

<p>Charles Wood asked me to go to Graham and find out
what his views were about the West Indian question, and
whether he was prepared to grant the West Indians any
relief, and to meddle with the Bill of 1846. I went to him
yesterday morning, and was with him for two hours, talking
about everything and everybody.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUARREL WITH SPAIN.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 14th.</i>&mdash;Graham said about the West Indians that
the old proprietors must be ruined, nothing could save them.
New purchasers who went out and cultivated these estates
might do well, but men <i>here</i> could no longer derive incomes
from sugar duties; he would not disturb the arrangement of
1846, though he thought the Government had been wrong
in making it, and he and Peel had only supported them
because if they had been beaten they would have gone out.
Nor would he give any money; said that the Committees
now sitting would recommend doing away with the African
fleet and the whole of our anti-slavery machinery, and that
all that could be done for the West Indians was to authorise
a sort of regulated slave trade, procuring labourers
and making them free; the people of this country had
tasted cheap sugar, and would not now go back to dear; he
anticipated no difficulty from the French Government in
doing away with the Treaty, but much from Palmerston,
who would hardly be brought to propose it. We talked
much of the Spanish correspondence, of Palmerston, John
Russell, and the rest; Graham could not understand how
Lord Grey stood it, seeing that everything that had happened
had justified him in his original objections. He told me a
story of John Russell's having sat by somebody (I found out
afterwards it was Ellice), just after the suppression of the
insurrection at Madrid, to whom he expressed his satisfaction
at the Government having put it down, and added, 'Think
of that fool Bulwer having taken that opportunity to make an
attempt in favour of the Progressista party,' which Graham
said was a proof that he had not known anything of Palmerston's
instructions. I did not tell him what the real state of
the case was. He said that he and Peel did not want to turn
the Government out, nor embarrass them, and therefore gave
me to understand that they should not take any part against
Palmerston; but he severely criticised his conduct, and was
evidently very glad at his getting into such a scrape. His
general views were very apparent to me; he has a great
contempt for the Government, thinks nobody has done well
but Sir George Grey and Clarendon, but is biding his time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
and acting on the policy which I long ago saw was the true
one, of making a junction with the Whigs possible hereafter.
He is very much provoked with Lincoln and Gladstone, who
he said were 'impatient,' and acting in a spirit of most injudicious
half hostility and annoyance to the Government;
he sees all the inconvenience of this course, but he does not
choose to interfere, and I perceive he does not like Lincoln
nor think highly of him. His object is to have as many
doors open to himself and Peel as is possible by-and-by, and
he looks to govern upon such popular principles, and at the
same time safe ones, as may enable them to raise a standard
that will have attraction for all moderate, sensible, and
liberal people. He anticipates a great part to be played by
Francis Baring, of whose talents and influence he thinks
highly; that he is greatly improved in speaking; and being
now head of the great family of Baring, opulent, with a
strong mind and will, very rigid and severe in his principles,
he must be a very conspicuous and powerful man in public
life. I have no doubt he would like to coalesce with Baring
by-and-by, and have him for Chancellor of the Exchequer in
their Government when they make one; he talked of Aberdeen
and the way he was 'cottoning' himself to Stanley;
owned that these times of universal revolution were unsuitable
to the genius and taste of Aberdeen, who was an
excellent foreign minister with Peel, adopting his free trade
principles, and dealing with monarchical Europe; but now
the scholar of Castlereagh, whose inclinations all lay towards
Metternich and Guizot, was disgusted and disheartened at
the spectacle Europe presented. I hinted that this might
in some degree prove convenient, which he perfectly understood.

<p class="entry"><i>Stud House: May 22nd and 25th, 1848.</i>&mdash;In these times
a hiatus of ten days leaves an immense arrear of events and
circumstances of different sorts. The principal one last
week was the strange scene in the French Chamber and the
conspiracy against its independence which was so completely
frustrated. It is never worth while to describe scenes which
are better and more circumstantially narrated in the newspapers.
The spirit of order was completely victorious, but
the conduct of those who have got the upper hand is still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
very unaccountable.<a href="#Footnote_48" id="FNanchor_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
People go on wondering that Lamartine
should be so irresolute, and that he should endure Ledru
Rollin as a colleague. Madame de Lieven supplied me with
the solution of this question which I dare say is the true one.
She told me that Roberts the painter (who brought her away
from Paris) came to her the other day and told her that the
Revolution found Lamartine as well as Ledru Rollin ruined
men, and that they formed a compact to feather their
nests, which both have accomplished. While they have been
ostensibly (and perhaps really) the heads of different sections
of the Government and the promoters of different principles,
they have always been connected by a secret understanding
and a common interest, and therefore they cannot break
with each other, and accordingly whenever the moderate
party appear to have the upper hand and cry out to Lamartine
to come forward and crush his colleague, Lamartine, on
the contrary, shuffles, temporises and compromises, and so
he and Ledru Rollin go on together. The consequence of all
this is that there is no Government in France, and all the
material interests of the country keep getting worse and
worse, and ruin stares everybody in the face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON THE RUPTURE WITH SPAIN.</div>

<p>On Monday morning before I came here I learnt that
there had been a fresh matter of complaint against Palmerston,
which had given Lord John great annoyance. It
seems that several days ago Brunnow communicated to
Palmerston that the Emperor of Russia had determined to
make common cause with the King of Denmark, and at the
same time he made this known to the Prince of Prussia.<a href="#Footnote_49" id="FNanchor_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
The next day the Prince went to pay a visit to the Queen,
when he alluded to this important communication; the
Queen was excessively embarrassed, for she had never heard
a word about it, Palmerston having omitted to tell her. As
soon as the Prince was gone, she sent for Lord John Russell,
who was at Richmond. He came up to town and went to the
Queen, who told him what had passed, describing her embarrassment,
but said that she thought it better not to let the
Prince know she was in ignorance of such a matter, and she
had therefore pretended to be aware of it. By mere accident
John Russell himself had received a box from Palmerston
with this communication a few minutes before he went to
the Queen; if it had arrived ten minutes later he would
have known nothing about it either. This coming after the
Spanish affair, and so soon, does not improve Palmerston's
position with the Queen or his colleagues.</p>

<p>I found the Duke of Bedford, who had sent for me, much
disturbed at a communication he had received from Arbuthnot,
who told him that the Government would be very hard
pressed on Friday upon Bankes' motion on the Spanish correspondence;<a href="#Footnote_50" id="FNanchor_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
that the motion had been settled by Bankes
and Lincoln together, and approved by Stanley; that all the
Protectionists would support it; and if Hume and the Radicals
did so likewise, the Government would be beaten. All this
Arbuthnot had learnt from a Protectionist friend, who added
that he did not know what Peel and Graham and their friends
would do. This latter point I undertook to ascertain, and I
forthwith called on Graham and asked him. He told me
that both he and Peel would support the Government, not
approving Palmerston's conduct, but not wishing to damage
the Government, and not thinking it fair or proper to inflict
upon Palmerston a Parliamentary censure. He told me
what he should say on the occasion, which I need not say
here, as he will say it himself. We had a great deal of talk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
about the state of affairs. I told him what was said about
Lincoln and Bankes, and what the effect of Lincoln's conduct
was; he deplored it very much, and said that it was not only
very imprudent but very unfair to others, but that he could
do nothing about it. If Peel was like other men he would
keep Lincoln straight, and it behoves him especially to do
so, as Lincoln is supposed to be his favourite adherent.</p>

<p>Yesterday I rode to the course at Epsom with Clanricarde,
and we talked about Palmerston and John Russell. He
said that such things as had lately happened were not to
happen again, but that he thought there had not been enough
of common consultation and understanding in their Cabinet
upon important matters; he did not think Palmerston had
done <i>many</i> objectionable things, but owned that John Russell
was not fit to be the <i>head</i> of a Government, was admirable
in the House of Commons, but wanting in the qualities
that a Prime Minister ought to have.</p>

<p>While this Spanish debate is impending, the difficulty of
the case is greatly increased by the news of Bulwer's having
been driven out of Madrid, his passport sent him, and he himself
ordered to quit it in forty-eight hours; and last night I
received a letter from him announcing his arrival and begging
to see me. I saw Stanley at Epsom, who said that this
event had rendered it very difficult to know what course to
pursue; he concludes that Narvaez could not have taken
such a step without having sufficient evidence to prove that
they had a good case against Bulwer, and that this evidence
must have been transmitted to our Government. I am going
to London to see Bulwer to hear his story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR HENRY BULWER'S DEFENCE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 30th.</i>&mdash;I called on Bulwer on Thursday, found him
with Delane, and soon after Hayward came in, so had no
opportunity of questioning him. He told his story in a long,
rambling style, pretty much as the Spanish papers give it; he
said he had originally sent a long account to Palmerston of
the state of parties in Spain, and the character of the principal
men, and advised him to be on good terms with
Narvaez and his Government. He did not say what answer
Palmerston sent, but I inferred that it did not meet his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
views. The thing that struck me was the knowledge which
he betrayed of the plots or intrigues that were going on
against the Government, and it does not appear either from
these papers or from what he said to me that he ever gave
the benefit of his information to the Spanish Ministers.
For example, he knew of the military insurrection, the day
on which, the place at which, it was to take place, who was
to command it, and, in short, particulars which implied
familiarity, if not complicity, with the conspirators. Then
there appears to have been a system of offensive and injudicious
interference, and in the functions discharged by
the English Minister one searches in vain for any international
interest, or anything in which we are concerned,
and he seems only to have existed at Madrid to meddle
and give officious, unrequired, and unwelcome advice. The
whole affair is at present in a very embarrassing state, but
the man who takes it the most lightly is Palmerston himself.
Everybody condemns the spirit of meddling which
Palmerston has exhibited in this as in so many instances,
and even those who think his interference warrantable,
admit that his tone and manner have been very injudicious
and in exceeding bad taste. At present his colleagues show
no disposition to give him up, and his will is so strong and
he is so daring and reckless, while they are all so feeble and
yielding, that he will probably harness them all to his car
and make them assist in lugging him out of the difficulty.
This affair will, however, prove a source of discredit out
of the Cabinet, and of weakness and dissension within it.
There is not a Minister who does not feel more or less disgusted
and alarmed at Palmerston's proceedings, and still
more at his character. Out of doors the reprehension is
universal. Graham, who had announced his opposition to
Bankes' motion and his intention to assist the Government,
has now communicated to them (through me) that he can
pledge himself to no course till he shall have seen all the
papers and heard all the explanations on the subject.
Bulwer and Isturitz met at Palmerston's dinner on the
Queen's birthday, and accosted each other very cordially.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
It was remarked that the Queen was very civil to Isturitz at
the Levée.</p>

<p>The account of Mitchell's conviction<a href="#Footnote_51" id="FNanchor_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> has given great
satisfaction here, and compensated for the defeats in the
other cases. The good of it is that the Government have
proved to the Irish and to the world that they have the
means of punishing these enormous offenders, and that they
will not be able to pursue their turbulent and factious course
with impunity. The three hundred imitators whom Mitchell
announced as ready to encounter similar martyrdom will
probably not be forthcoming. So far as the system of terror
is concerned, which is the only one we can now employ, it is
a great and happy event, but it will not contribute to the
regeneration of the country, and will probably augment the
fund of accumulating hatred against English connexion.
Still, anything is better than political impotence, and, before
any attempt can be made to introduce those practical improvements
which may disarm the Irish of their prejudices
and animosities, the power of the law and the Government
must be firmly asserted and enforced. An incident has,
however, accompanied these trials which is not pleasant to
the Government. The Whigs, and Lord John Russell at the
head of them, when in opposition, bitterly attacked the
conduct of the Law Officers in their jury challenges in the
political trials. On this occasion, the Whig Law officers
found they must either do exactly as their predecessors had
done, or connive at their own defeat. They wisely and
properly chose the former alternative, but of course at the
cost of exposing the present Government to charges of gross
inconsistency. Last night in the House of Commons the
subject was touched upon, and John Russell had the imprudence
to read part of a private letter from Clarendon, referring
to the conduct of the late Government in striking
the jury in O'Connell's case as open to reproach. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
brought up Graham, who affirmed that the instructions
given by his Government and those given by the present
Government were precisely the same, which John Russell
was obliged to admit. The allusion, however, gave offence
both to Graham and to Peel. The former has written me a
note about it this morning, by which I see that he is a good
deal nettled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MIRASOL'S MISSION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 31st.</i>&mdash;Yesterday Lord Grey called on the Duke of
Bedford to talk over the Spanish affair, at which he is beginning
to kick, though very gently. The present state of
the case is this: from all that appears in public, the Spanish
Government has been wholly unjustifiable, and we are not
likely to know more as yet, for Mirasol<a href="#Footnote_52" id="FNanchor_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> having brought no
credentials, Palmerston refuses to receive him, and has desired
him to convey what he has to say through Isturitz; but he
came away in such a hurry (running a race with Bulwer)
that he left all his papers behind him, and accordingly
he has nothing to show. What between the awkwardness
of the Spaniards, the artfulness of Palmerston, and the
reluctance there is on all sides to push the Government
to extremities, it appears most likely that the discussions
in Parliament will produce no other result than a good
deal of talk, and some expression of an opinion that the
Spanish Government has been very impertinent. But nobody
cares about the affront they have offered us, for the
simple reason that it is universally considered as aimed at
Palmerston and Bulwer, and that both have provoked it by
their own insolent and unbecoming interference, the matter
and the manner of which are equally condemned. It is now
reported that Palmerston means to insist on sending Bulwer
back to Madrid, for no other reason, of course, than to make
the Spaniards eat humble pie; and, for the sake of achieving
a personal triumph, he will not mind making the English
Government and country odious in Spain. Every day the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
difficulties of the Government increase, and its weakness
becomes more apparent, but without any tolerable alternative
presenting itself. The friends and subordinates of the
Government acknowledge this. There is a general sense of
rottenness, and a consciousness that they inspire no confidence.
Hawes told me yesterday that 'he was nobody, and
could only shrug up his shoulders at all he saw.' They
were beaten last night (on small matters, it is true) in both
Houses,<a href="#Footnote_53" id="FNanchor_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
and now there appears a very good chance of their
being beaten on the resolutions of the West Indian Committee,
which has reported to the House in favour of a duty
on sugar of ten shillings for six years. Lord John at once
declared he should oppose it. The division in the Committee
was a very curious one; this resolution was carried by seven
to five, and by a strange crossing over of opposite parties.
Goulburn and Cardwell did not vote; two or three Whigs
voted for it.</p>

<p>The Princess Sophia<a href="#Footnote_54" id="FNanchor_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
died a few days ago, while the
Queen was holding the Drawing-room for her Birthday.
She was blind, helpless, and suffered martyrdom; a very
clever, well-informed woman, but who never lived in the
world. She was the intimate friend of the Duke of York
while he lived, and of the Duchess of Gloucester up to the
last. The Princess left a letter for the Queen, which was
delivered to her in the garden of Buckingham Palace by
Andrew Drummond on Monday morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GREY'S REMONSTRANCE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;Isturitz has sent in Mirasol's case, which, he
admits himself, is no case at all, flimsy and weak, and
unsupported by proofs. This, however, though it puts the
Spanish Government in the wrong, does not thereby relieve
our embarrassment; for, while it imposes on us the necessity
of requiring some reparation for so gross an affront, it is very
difficult to know what to demand; and if the Spaniards don't
comply, what are we to do next? There seems to be very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
little doubt that the coals have been blown by Louis Philippe
and Guizot, the latter of whom is in constant correspondence
with Madrid, as our Government have ascertained, and both
are animated with the strongest desire to do Palmerston an
ill turn.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the affair has become more serious here.
Lord Grey has at last been to John Russell, and in very
temperate terms told him matters cannot any longer go
on as they have done, and he afterwards went to the Duke
of Bedford, and told him what he had done. Grey learnt
for the first time, when he spoke to Lord John, what had
happened about the despatch to which Lord John had
objected. The Duke wrote his brother a very long letter,
setting forth all the danger and discredit which accrued
to the Government from their proceedings, and the discontent
which was produced amongst their friends. Lord
John took this letter in good part, and he told the Duke
that if they got over this affair something must be settled
for the future. He at the same time gave him another
anecdote as an example of Palmerston's way of doing business,
which fortunately ended without mischief, but might
have had a very different result. One day when the Duc de
Broglie was with Palmerston, he asked him if there was any
news. Palmerston said he had just got a box, which he had
not yet opened, but he would open it then. He did so,
found a despatch from Howden on the subject of the Monte
Video business, and gave it to the Duc de Broglie to read.
The Duc read it, said that its contents were not pleasant,
and remonstrated against them, whatever they were, which
I do not know, and, for the point of the story, does not
signify. Immediately after, Palmerston joined the Queen in
Scotland, leaving the conduct of this affair in the hands of
John Russell. Lord John and the Duc de Broglie came to
an understanding, but in the meanwhile Palmerston wrote a
despatch to Normanby on the subject, which passed through
London without being communicated to Lord John Russell.
This, which Normanby was instructed to read to Guizot,
surprised him very much, and he told Normanby that it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
different from what the Duc de Broglie had given him reason
to expect. This annoyed Normanby very much, and as it
placed him in a very awkward situation, he complained of it.
The matter was then explained, and eventually Guizot acted
with so much moderation that it was adjusted amicably.
Palmerston when urged on the subject threw the blame on
the Foreign Office, which they say he is constantly in the
habit of doing.</p>

<p>I learn to my great astonishment that all the Queen's
former attachment to Louis Philippe and the French Royal
Family has revived in greater force than ever; she says
the marriages are not to be thought of any more. Nothing
but the extraordinary good sense of Prince Albert and the
boundless influence he has over her keeps her affectionate
feelings under due restraint; but for him she would have
made all her household go to Claremont, and when the French
Royal Family have come to visit her she has received them as
King and Queen, and one day one of the children went up
to Louis Philippe and called him 'Your Majesty,' which
had no doubt been done by the Queen's commands. I take
for granted that they have persuaded the Queen that their
ruin has been the work of Palmerston, for this is what they
always say, and possibly they believe it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WEST INDIA COMMITTEE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 3rd.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning I saw Graham. He said
matters were going on worse and worse; the Government
seemed to be paralysed, and to have lost their understandings.
They had such a night on Tuesday in the House
of Commons as he never witnessed. He then enumerated
their defeats and their blunders and mismanagement, without
bitterness but with great contempt. They sustained a
defeat on Bowring's motion about the collection of taxes, a
very important matter, not having got their people down.
I found out afterwards that they did not expect a division,
and thought to prevent one by counting out the House, and
to aid this Sir George Grey told people who were waiting
there they had better go away. This was blundering. Then
they made a great mistake in fighting the Derby writ, in
which they, in conjunction with the Protectionists, got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
beaten by the Liberals and the Peelites. On Anstey's
Roman Catholic Relief Bill none of the Government were
present. On Thursday night Lord John came down with
two very foolish notices, one for our alteration of the Oath
(which is only a new Jew bill in a fresh form), and another
to relieve voters from disqualification on account of non-payment
of the assessed taxes, which was intended as a sop
to Hume before his Reform motion. Both these Graham
denounced as weak and unwise. I asked him what they
thought of the resolution of the West India Committee.<a href="#Footnote_55" id="FNanchor_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
He said it was very awkward. He was as strong as ever
against the proposition, and the best reason he gave was
that it would be of no service to the West Indians if it was
carried; that if all foreign sugar was prohibited they would
be as much swamped by Mauritius and the East as by
Cuba and Brazil. He will, therefore, oppose it; but he is
not sure the Government may not be in a minority, and I
told him if Lord John was defeated on it I really believed
he would resign. He said he thought the Protectionists
were prepared to form a Government if they carried the
resolution. I do not, however, believe any such thing, and
I reminded him that such a division, composed as the
majority would be of the most heterogeneous materials,
would be no test of their strength as a party; and that if
they were mad enough to attempt it, and the Queen would
consent (which she never would) to let them, they would
not stay in three days. He said they must dissolve; they
had no other course, and that revolution would be the inevitable
consequence of a dissolution and a fresh election at
such a time as this; that such a Parliament would be returned
as we had never seen; Hume's reform and the four points
would be carried, and the Monarchy swept away. However,
though he believes these results would follow from the
formation of a Stanley Government, he does not, I am sure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
for a moment, contemplate such a contingency as within the
limits of possibility. I told the Duke of Bedford all Graham
had said, and that he might make any use of the knowledge
this gave him of the Government proceedings to put matters
if he could in a better train. He said he would talk to
Lord John, though he hates doing so, for he is always suffering
under that deplorable infirmity of Lord John's&mdash;his
disinclination to hear unpalatable truths, and above all to
be found fault with. The consequence of this is that he
receives everybody ill who goes to him to tell him what he
does not like to hear, and nobody now but the Duke (and he
very reluctantly) will go to him to tell him what he ought to
hear. The Duke said he agreed with Graham as to the
consequences of a Protectionist Government, but that it was
out of the question, and if Lord John was forced to resign,
Peel must take the Government, and the Whig party must
join and support him; and between some of the present
Cabinet and some of the late a very strong Government
might be formed.</p>

<p>I afterwards saw Lord Grey, who talked to me about the
state of the Government, and what had passed between Lord
John and him touching Palmerston. He said that he only
came into office with a distinct understanding that Lord
John should exercise a control over the Foreign Office and
secure the Cabinet against any imprudence of Palmerston's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARTISM IN THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>The Government are now getting seriously uneasy about
the Chartist manifestations in various parts of the country,
especially in London, and at the repeated assemblings and
marchings of great bodies of men. Le Marchant told me
that two or three months ago, when he was at the Home
Office, he received accounts he thought very alarming of the
wide-spreading disaffection of the people, and particularly of
the enormous increase of cheap publications of the most
mischievous and inflammatory character, which were disseminated
among the masses and eagerly read; and lately,
accounts have been received from well-informed persons,
whose occupations lead them to mix with the people, clergymen&mdash;particularly
Roman Catholic&mdash;and medical men, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
report that they find a great change for the worse amongst
them, an increasing spirit of discontent and disaffection,
and that many who on the 10th of April went out as special
constables declare they would not do so again if another
manifestation required it. The speeches which are made at
the different meetings are remarkable for the coarse language
and savage spirit they display. It is quite new to hear any
Englishmen coolly recommend assassination, and the other
day a police superintendent was wounded in the leg by some
sharp instrument. These are new and very bad symptoms,
and it is impossible not to feel alarm when we consider the
vast amount of the population as compared with any repressive
power we possess. The extent and reality of the distress
they suffer, the impossibility of expecting such masses of
people to be eternally patient and forbearing, to restrain all
their natural impulses, and endure tamely severe privations
when they are encouraged and stimulated to do otherwise,
and are thus accessible to every sort of internal and external
temptation,&mdash;all these considerations may well beget a
serious presentiment of danger. But though many do feel
this and brood much over it, there appears to be a fatal
security amongst the majority, whose sluggish minds cannot
be awakened to the possibility of a great convulsion here,
notwithstanding the continental conflagration that stares
them in the face. What we principally want is a strong
Government which shall obtain public confidence and respect,
and which may have a chance of conciliating, satisfying, and
keeping in check public opinion. This the divisions and
subdivisions of parties, and the enduring enmities and
vindictive feelings of the Conservatives, effectually prevent.
The only strong Government that could be formed would
be a Liberal one under Peel, and the Protectionists would
rather encounter the chances of revolution than see the man
whom they detest so bitterly at the head of affairs again.
They are so blind to their own interest, or so insane in their
resentment, that they would prefer to run the risk of all that
Radicals or Chartists could do than owe their safety to Peel,
whom they affect to think the enemy of their best interests,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
and a man not to be trusted; and this they go on harping upon,
although half of them now admit that it is the greatest blessing
to them to have been saved by his measures from the dangerous
predicament in which they would now otherwise be.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;At Ascot all last week. The Spanish debate
went off just as might have been expected; all fought in
muffled gloves, and as the outrageous conduct of the Spanish
Government rendered it a national affair, it was impossible
to attack either Palmerston or Bulwer; but the latter was not
only not <i>attacked</i>, but he was bepraised by everybody to an
extent that now seems ridiculous. Peel said all that Graham
told me he should say, praising Bulwer and quizzing Palmerston,
while he <i>affected</i> to defend him. Guizot saw all this farce
with considerable vexation, mixed with disdain, but it could
not take any other turn all circumstances considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARTIST AGITATION.</div>

<p>The Government have at last taken strong measures
against the Chartists; but in spite of the arrest of some of
their leaders, another demonstration is expected on Monday,
for which great preparations are to be made. These demonstrations
are getting a great bore, besides being very
mischievous. The townspeople, who are thus perpetually
alarmed, are growing very angry, and the military are so
savage that Lord Londonderry told the Duke of Wellington
he was sure, if a collision took place, the officers of his regiment
would not be able to restrain their men. Many people
think that a severe chastisement of these mobs will alone
put a stop to their proceedings, and that it will be better
the troops should be allowed to act and open fire upon
them. This is an extremity which must be avoided if possible,
but anything is better than allowing such an evil as
this to go on increasing. But if these multitudes of discontented
men can be daunted into submission, fearful considerations
remain behind. We have an enormous overgrown
population, a vast proportion of which are in undeniable
misery and distress, and are soured and exasperated by their
sufferings. To expect such beings to be reasonable, and still
more to be logical, is to expect a moral impossibility. While
the minds of the masses are in a combustible state, and they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
are ready to listen to anybody who appears to sympathise
with them, and who pretends to be able to put them in the
way of mending their condition, there are not wanting agents
who strive with all their might, and not without success, to
inflame and mislead them. The suffering people are prompt
to believe that that cannot be a sound and just condition
of society in which they are abandoned to starvation and
destitution, while other classes are revelling in luxury and
enjoyment. They have confused notions that this is all
wrong, and that under some different political dispensation
their interests would be better cared for, and according
to their necessities they would be comforted and relieved.
They are neither able to comprehend nor disposed to
listen to the long processes of argument by which it might
be demonstrated to them that all the prevailing misery and
distress are attributable to causes over which Government
has no control, and which no legislation can counteract:
the unhappy state of the world, the confusion which prevails
everywhere, the interruption of regular industry, the disturbance
of the ordinary course of social life, and the universal
poverty and suffering react upon this country and to
a certain degree undermine the broad foundations on which
our social and political fabric stands. We are not indeed
yet shaken from our equilibrium, but there is a restlessness,
an apprehension, a heaving and struggling, which appear like
warnings and forerunners of a possible earthquake. We
seem to have got into another stage of existence, our world
is almost suddenly altered, we deal with new questions, men
seem to be animated with fresh objects; what are called
politics, international questions and the strife of parties, sink
into insignificance; society is stirred up from its lowest
depths, and we are obliged to turn our eyes and thoughts
and faculties to the vast spectacle that is laid bare before
us&mdash;and an appalling and awful spectacle it is which may
well make the most thoughtless reflect, and turn levity and
indifference into seriousness and fear.<a href="#Footnote_56" id="FNanchor_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 11th.</i>&mdash;A very good debate on Friday night on the
Navigation Laws, and a good division and majority. Peel
made an excellent speech.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 13th.</i>&mdash;John Russell was highly delighted with
Peel's speech on Friday, says he behaved most handsomely,
and that he is not like the same man. The virulence and
immortal hate of his quondam friends was exhibited in the
most indecent manner on this occasion. When he rose to
speak they tried to hoot and bellow him down, and at the
head of these vulgar clamourers was a Judge, the Recorder
Law; it was a very disgraceful scene, and shows what an
incorrigible faction they are.</p>

<p>It seems that Lord John's proposition about altering
the oaths, has had the effect of preventing a fresh election
in the City, which was viewed with great dread by
everybody, but which would otherwise have taken place.
Lord John will now make a speech and announce his plan,
but not attempt to carry any Bill this year. This will satisfy
Rothschild, who will not stir, but wait to see the result of
the measure in the next session. The Oaths are very absurd
and want altering. There are two Peers&mdash;Lord Bradford and
Lord Clancarty&mdash;who will not take them, nor consequently
their seats in the House of Lords; and the Duke of Bedford
told me, that though he had taken them, as a matter of
course, he doubted if he could bring himself to do so again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARTIST DEMONSTRATION FAILS.</div>

<p>The expected Chartist demonstration yesterday ended in
smoke, both here and in the provinces; nevertheless great
preparations were made of military, police, and special constables.
It rained torrents the whole day, which probably
would have been enough to prevent any assemblages of
people; but the determined attitude of the Government
and the arrests that have taken place intimidated the leaders.
Everybody had got bored and provoked to death with these
continued alarms, but it is now thought that we shall not
have any more of them. The Chartists themselves must get
tired of meeting and walking about for nothing, and they
can hardly fail to lose all confidence in their leaders, whose
actions so ill correspond with their promises and professions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
A man of the name of MacDougal, who appears to be the
chief of the London Chartists, harangued his rabble a few
days ago, declared the meeting should take place in spite of
Government, and announced the most heroic intentions. He
went to the ground (at one of the <i>rendezvous</i>), and finding a
magistrate there, asked him if the meeting was illegal, and
if the Government really intended to prevent it. The magistrate
referred him to the printed placard, by which he would
see that it was illegal, and that the Government did intend
to prevent it; on which he made a bow, said he did not
mean to oppose the law, would go away, and advise his
friends to do the same; and off he went. The failures
have been complete everywhere, and nobody feels any alarm;
nevertheless the spirit and the sour disaffection, and the
vast numbers that are infected with it, are dangerous, and
may some day be productive of serious consequences.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 18th.</i>&mdash;On Friday the Government had a bad night
in the House of Commons. John Russell brought forward
his West India plan (concocted by Wilson), which was very
ill received on all sides, and met by objections from the most
opposite quarters and on the most opposite grounds; he
made a very bad opening speech, but a very good reply.
The Protectionists were very violent, and Hawes was furiously
attacked about a despatch of Sir Charles Grey's, which he
had not produced to the West India Committee, and which
he was accused of unfairly suppressing. It was a very ugly
case, and afforded George Bentinck and Disraeli materials
for much triumph and abuse, of which they largely availed
themselves. These personal affairs, which have a discreditable
look, are always very damaging, and there is again
a notion abroad of Lord John's feebleness, and of the impossibility
of his conducting the Government when the
times are so difficult and his health so frail. The Government
are very confident that they shall carry their West
India measure, notwithstanding the storm of reproach with
which it is assailed.</p>

<p>The curtain has fallen on another act of the Spanish
drama, Isturitz having been civilly sent out of this country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
The papers present a case all to our advantage. Bulwer's
despatch of May 30, in vindication of himself, was very well
done, and Palmerston's last note to Isturitz excellent. The
Spaniards have played their cards (not bad ones originally)
so miserably ill, that they have given the game to our Foreign
Office, though it is difficult to say what the stake is worth;
they are, however, like people who had a very good hand,
but revoked at a critical moment, and so lost the game.
Bulwer and Palmerston are triumphantly curvetting about,
completely smashing their antagonists in argument, partly
because the latter are blunderers who have deceived themselves
and been misled by others, and partly because they
cannot put forth their true case and the reasons which have
influenced them. They know perfectly well that Palmerston
and Bulwer have all along moved heaven and earth to keep
or drive Narvaez out of office, and Montpensier out of Spain,
while Sotomayor has put forward frivolous or unsustainable
pretexts for the violent and rash course they have adopted.
Narvaez is compelled to keep back the real case he had
against Bulwer, and the cause of his animosity towards
him. He knows that Bulwer tried to prevent his coming
into power; that he was the life and soul, the leader and
director of the faction opposed to him, whom he instigated
to adopt the most violent measures. I read in Bulwer's own
handwriting an account of his proceedings and of the failure
of his schemes. It was through Serrano all this was to be
done, but Serrano was under the influence of his mother,
and Narvaez of his doctor, and these were both corrupted by
the other side. This was the cause of failure. Then Serrano,
as all the world knows, was himself brought over, and he has
since given to Narvaez in writing a detailed account of his
communication with Bulwer, and of the conduct of the
latter, but in which the Queen is so implicated and compromised,
that it is impossible for Narvaez to make any use
of it. This Guizot (who knows everything that passes at
Madrid) told Reeve, and I have no doubt it is true, because
it corresponds with that letter of Bulwer's which I myself
saw. This is the secret history of the matter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AN IMPENDING CRISIS.</div>

<p>I find Clarendon's views in respect to the government of
Ireland are becoming known, and producing no small sensation.<a href="#Footnote_57" id="FNanchor_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
Lord Barrington asked me the other night if it was
true that his opinions had undergone a great change, and
that he was now convinced Ireland could only be governed
in connexion with and by the support of the Orangemen. I
told him there was, I apprehended, much exaggeration in
this, but some truth; that I conceived a man of his penetration
could not have governed Ireland for a year without
seeing that the whole Catholic body were either disaffected
and dangerous, or so timid as to be useless, and that in fact
the Protestants alone were to be depended upon for attachment
to the British connexion, and resolution to support it,
but that I was convinced he would not suffer the ingratitude
and misconduct of the Catholics to interfere with his
determination to render equal justice to all.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 24th.</i>&mdash;We are on the brink of a crisis and one of a
most fearful nature. This sugar question is going to destroy
this Government, as former sugar questions have destroyed
former Governments. Until yesterday I was satisfied that
Government would not think it necessary to resign if beaten
on Pakington's amendment, and Hobhouse, whom I met the
other day, seemed to think they need not. Many of them,
however, thought differently, and yesterday there was a
Cabinet, at which they came to a unanimous resolution
to resign. The Duke of Bedford thought as I had done, and
strongly urged Lord John not to resign; this he told me
yesterday morning, but that he had not been able to convince
him. After I saw him I went to Graham; I found
him in great alarm at the state of affairs and the prospect of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the country. He said that he expected the Government
would be beaten, and that he did not see how they could go
on if they were; he approved of their resigning; that it was
a vote of censure or want of confidence, and that in fact
they had lost all hold of the House of Commons; that they
had done so in great measure by their own blunders and
follies; and he then enumerated many of these; and he was
satisfied they had so lost credit and power that they could
not go on, and therefore if they survived this vote they
would fall by some other. He then told me that Peel's
friends had separated themselves from him, and would vote
with the Protectionists; he and Peel should support the
Government, but he did not know for certain of any others
who would go with them; he should do so with great reluctance
he owned, but he would not turn them out. The rest
of the Peelites are angry with Peel for supporting the
Government as he had done; they were impatient, could
no longer be restrained, and were resolved to join the Protectionists.
Graham had had no communication with any of
them, but he concluded they were and must be ready to join
Stanley and take office under him if he invited them. He
looked on Stanley's coming into office as inevitable. I asked
him what his Cabinet would be: he supposed principally
Peel's old Cabinet with George Bentinck and Disraeli; and
he then descanted on all the evils and dangers to be apprehended
from their assumption of power however brief, much
as he did in our former conversation; the great impetus it
would give to reform, and the vast power the Radical and
subversive interest would acquire; in fact, his anticipations
are of the most serious and gloomy character&mdash;foreseeing the
downfall of the Church, the House of Lords, and the Crown
itself. In the afternoon I told the Duke of Bedford what he
had said of the defection of the Peelites from their chief, and
that this event would be openly manifested in the course of
the present debate. The Duke was to dine at the Palace,
where I knew he would have a great deal of conversation
with the Queen, so I called on him this morning to hear
what had passed. She and the Prince entered into it all,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and were aware of what was impending, for Lord John had
prepared her for it. She said she was very sorry, as everything
had gone on very smoothly with one exception. Lord
John has made up his mind to advise her to send for Stanley,
and she is prepared to do so. Nobody now doubts that Stanley,
if sent for, means to undertake it, and this is the state
of affairs up to this time. There was a most scandalous
scene in the House of Commons last night, originating in
the virulence of George Bentinck's attack on Hawes; but
I know nothing of it as yet but from the newspaper report.<a href="#Footnote_58" id="FNanchor_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">IRRITATION OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 25th.</i>&mdash;Everybody was full of the scene in the House
of Commons, which seems to have been to the last degree
deplorable and disgraceful, calculated to bring the House of
Commons into contempt. Everybody behaved ill; nothing
could exceed the intemperance of George Bentinck's attack
on Grey and Hawes, accusing them in terms not to be
mistaken of wilful suppression of documents, and then the
most disgraceful shuffling and lying to conceal what they
had done and escape from the charges against them. On
the other hand, John Russell lost his temper; and as gentlemen
in that predicament usually do, at the same time lost
his good taste and good sense. He twitted George Bentinck
with his turf pursuits, and managed to make what he said
appear more offensive than it really was intended to be.
This brought Disraeli to the defence of his friend, and he
poured forth a tide of eloquent invective and sarcasm which
was received with frantic applause by his crew; they roared
and hooted and converted the House of Commons into such
a bear-garden as no one ever saw before. When Hawes got
up to defend himself they would not hear him, and attempted
to bellow him down with groans and 'ohs,' spurning all sense
of justice and decency. It was grief and scandal to all
reasonable men. Peel sat it out and never uttered a word,
but he cheered Hawes when he was speaking.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PEEL'S RELUCTANCE TO TAKE OFFICE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 26th.</i>&mdash;The state of the Government is like that of
a sick man, the bulletins of whose health continually vary,
one hour better with good hopes, another worse.<a href="#Footnote_59" id="FNanchor_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Yesterday
it looked up. Tufnell's list presented a chance of success;
he had sixty-nine doubtfuls, and they now think a good
many of these will vote with Government. Graham told
me yesterday he had thought Government sure to be beaten,
but he now found more people were disposed to go with Peel
than he had believed, and that he now rather expected a
majority. Many are waiting to hear Peel's speech, and
will be guided by him. Everybody is talking, however, of
what is to be done, and whom the Queen is to send for. The
Duke of Bedford has persuaded Lord John not to say anything
about resigning in his speech, and instead of at once
advising the Queen to send for Stanley, to consult Peel as to
the advice he shall give her. Melbourne has written to her
and advised her to send for Peel. Beauvale told me this,
and his notion is that a Government may be formed with
Aberdeen at the head of it. It is incredible what harm
Lord John's foolish speech on Friday night has done; it
will very likely influence the votes, and certainly will prove
very injurious to the Government; everybody thinks, let this
end as it may, that we have got to the beginning of the end.
At night I met Jocelyn, who told me that he meant to vote
with Lincoln and Sidney Herbert against Government. I
asked him how they could all be so foolish as not to follow
Peel's example and do as he did. He then informed me
that these Peelites have no intention whatever of joining
Stanley and taking office with him; their notion is that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Government is so weak and inefficient that it cannot stand,
and that it will be found so impossible to form any other,
that it cannot fail to fall into Peel's hands, and they expect
by a sort of gentle violence to compel him to take it, having
persuaded themselves that he will find a general support,
though they can't well say how or where. Such are the
tactics of the <i>impatients</i>; they hate the Whigs, and imagine
they can become a Government and be recruited by moderate
Conservatives and moderate Radicals, setting aside Whigs
and Protectionists. He hinted to me that <i>Peel might have
prevented their taking this course</i> if he disapproved of it. I
told him they were plucking the fruit before it was ripe.
On the other hand Graham discoursed largely on the impossibility
of Peel's coming into office, and repeated what he
has so often said before about party governments; the hatred
of the Whigs, of Peel, and still more of himself; Peel's fear
for his health, and the impression made on him by the fact
that nobody had ever led the House of Commons after sixty,
which Macaulay told him. I wasted a great deal of time
in arguing with him against objections which were all simulated
on his part. Every now and then he let out in the
way of admissions certain things which showed how ready
and anxious he really is to come in again whenever he can.
I asked him why Peel had not endeavoured to keep his youngsters
straight, and at all events given them good advice for
their conduct. He declared that he had done so. His conduct
is not very clear, and I have not that opinion of his
purity and singleness of purpose that would make me believe
his course has been altogether candid, straightforward, and
fair, not such as the Duke of Wellington's would have been,
but it is very difficult to know what he has really said and
done, and impossible to know what he really thinks, wishes,
and means. We were kept all yesterday in a state of intense
curiosity by the news of the fighting in the streets of
Paris.<a href="#Footnote_60" id="FNanchor_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 30th.</i>&mdash;On Tuesday I went to the House of Lords
to hear Lord Grey in the matter of the suppressed despatches,
and his defence against the various charges brought
by George Bentinck and others. He had been exceedingly
excited and was resolved to bring the matter forward,
though many people thought he had better leave it as it
was, and rest satisfied with what had passed in the House
of Commons. He promised himself, however, a signal vindication
and triumph, and the pleasure of severely chastising
his accusers, but it turned out a very unfortunate night, and
a painful one to those who heard the discussion. Grey made
a long and not judicious speech. He entered into too many
details, and said much that he had better have let alone.
Then Stanley rose, and after a complimentary exordium set
heartily to work, made a <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rehash">réchauffé</i> of George Bentinck's and
Disraeli's speeches with his own peculiar sauce of style and
diction, and made as bitter, ill-natured, and (all things considered)
as ill-timed an attack as ever was heard. But he
wound it up with a charge in reference to the memorial of
certain planters, which was certainly well founded and made
a very disagreeable impression. On this point Lord Grey
was clearly in the wrong and could make no sufficient defence
for himself; it has damaged him very much, and the
Government through him; and this affair has altogether
turned out very unhappily, for it has not only wounded the
credit and character, and thereby impaired the strength of
the Government, but it has struck at the honour of public
men, and this is in these times a great evil. There was a very
severe article in the 'Times' yesterday morning on Grey,
which was, however, not more than the truth. This affair
coming at a time when Government has nothing to spare in
point of credit and authority is peculiarly disastrous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARTY COMBINATIONS.</div>

<p>In the meantime, however, the division on Pakington's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
motion was generally known to be safe, and accordingly
there was a majority of fifteen against it last night, which
was ten or fifteen less than was expected; on Sunday last
Graham told me that he thought there would be a majority,
as he found many people meant to wait for Peel's speech
and would probably vote as he did. We then discussed
what should be done if the Government should be in a
minority, and consequently resign. The same evening I
wrote him a note and told him that I thought if this did
happen Lord John would consult Peel before he gave the
Queen any advice. I am sure he told Peel this, for on
Monday night I got a note from him (Graham) begging to
see me the next morning. I went to him, when he said
with great earnestness that he wanted to impress upon me
that it was of the greatest consequence that the Queen (in
case the necessity occurred) should send for Stanley forthwith,
and that without consulting anybody Lord John should
give her this advice. It was very desirable that there should
be no appearance of any concert between him and Peel,
while a consultation between them would certainly be known
to Stanley, and would take away much of the grace of sending
for him; that Stanley should have no excuse for declining,
and the Queen should tell him she was left without
a Government and that she placed herself in his hands,
giving him <i>carte blanche</i>, and telling him she was prepared
to agree to everything he proposed to her. He said he did
not believe Stanley would be able to form a Government,
still less to carry it on if he did form one; but he thought
it of the greatest consequence that his failure should be
complete, and that every opportunity and advantage should
be given to him. He urged this with an unction which
showed me clearly enough, if I had before had any doubt,
which I had not, what his secret thoughts and intentions
are, and that he is quite prepared, and Peel too, to come
into office provided circumstances turn out favourably for
Peel's resumption of power. I promised I would take care
that this should be done, and yesterday morning I told the
Duke of Bedford, who was just going off to Endsleigh.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Every day I find more evidence of the way in which people's
minds are turning towards Peel and anticipating his return
to power. Emily Eden told me that Auckland was very
anxious for a junction, and quite ready to give up his own
office to facilitate it. Matters are not yet ripe for such a
consummation, but it must end in this manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT BATTLE IN PARIS.</div>

<p>The details which reach us of the extraordinary contest
which has just taken place at Paris are equally horrible and
curious. Hitherto we have been struck by the absence of
that ferocity which distinguished the first Revolution, and
the little taste there seemed for shedding blood; but the
ferocity of the people broke out upon this occasion in the
most terrible examples. There was a savage rancour about
this exceeding the usual virulence of civil contests; the
people not only murdered, but tortured, their prisoners.
Since the victory the prisoners have been executed by hundreds,
and with hardly any form of trial; indeed, no trial
was possible or necessary, they were rebels taken <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="in the act">en flagrant
délit</i>, at once rebels and prisoners of war. One man, when
he was going to be shot, said he did not care, for he had had
his revenge already, and he pulled out of his pocket twenty
tongues that had been cut out. All agree that the organisation,
the military skill displayed, and the vast resources
the insurgents possessed in the material of war, were as extraordinary
as unaccountable. The preparations must have
been long before made, for the houses of their principal
fortifications were perforated for the purpose of communication
and escape, the staircase removed, and there were telegraphic
signals arranged by lights on the tops of the
buildings. There certainly was a commander-in-chief who
presided over the whole, but nobody knows who he was;
and the Government have never yet been able to ascertain
who the leaders were. Although distress and famine were
the prime causes of this great struggle, it is remarkable that
there was no plundering or robbery; on the contrary, they
were strictly forbidden and apparently never attempted. It
is the only example, so far as I know, that history records
of a pitched battle in the streets of a great capital between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the regular army and the armed civil power on one side, and
the populace of the town militarily armed and organised
also on the other, nobody knowing how the latter were
organised or by whom directed. Colonel Towneley, who
came from Paris last night, told me that it is believed that
the old Municipal Guard, who were disbanded by the Provisional
Government after the Revolution, had a great deal
to do with it, but that the skill with which the positions had
been chosen or fortified was perfect. Prodigies of valour
seem to have been performed on both sides, and the incidents
were to the last degree romantic. An Archbishop appearing
as a minister of peace in the midst of the fray, and mounting
the barricades to exhort the living and to bless the
dying amidst the din and fury of the contest, and then
perishing a martyr to his attempt to stop the effusion of
blood; women mixing in the contest, carrying ammunition
and supplies, daring everything, their opponents shrinking
from hunting these Amazons, and at last being obliged to
fire upon them in self-defence; the strange artifices employed
to convey arms and cartouches. The Garde Mobile, composed
of the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="kids in Paris">gamins de Paris</i>, signalised themselves with
peculiar heroism, and it is fortunate that they were on the
side of the Government instead of on that of the people.
There was one boy, not above fifteen or sixteen, a frightful
little urchin, who scaled three barricades one after another
and carried off the colours from each; Cavaignac embraced
him and gave him the Legion of Honour from his own person,
and he was carried in triumph and crowned with laurels to
a great banquet of his comrades. But it would be endless
to write down the particulars of a contest which fills the
columns of every newspaper now, and will be recorded in
innumerable books hereafter.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;Since the division on Pakington's motion the
Government stock has considerably risen, and they are now
generally considered safe for the present and for some indefinite
time to come; they will probably get their Sugar
Bill through. The loud complaints that have been made of
this waste of time in Parliament have not been without effect,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and there is an appearance of getting on with business. Then
the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement that the
deficit of 2,000,00<i>l.</i> will be reduced to 500,000<i>l.</i>, and that no
new taxes will be wanted, has put people in better humour.
The funds are rapidly rising, the harvest promises to be
good, and on the whole our prospects are considerably improved
within the last week. The state of the Continent,
though still bad enough, is somewhat more promising; there
appears to be something of a lull from exhaustion and perplexity,
there is a chance of the Danish quarrel being
arranged. The great victory in Paris, the establishment of
a strong military Government, and the evident determination
of the Assembly to promote the cause of law and order, and
to put down all the wild theories which have been in the
ascendant for the last three months, have largely tended to
brighten the political sky; and this example may encourage
others to act with the same vigour and in the same spirit.
The whole world is influenced by all that is done at Paris.
But in the midst of this improved prospect we have enough
to disturb our tranquillity; it will be impossible for a long
time for the Continent to be restored to a healthy state, and
its disturbed and impoverished condition fearfully reacts
upon us, and paralyses that foreign trade on which not
merely the prosperity but the subsistence of vast masses of
our population depends. We cannot therefore look forward
to anything but great distress and suffering in our manufacturing
population; and this, together with Ireland, are
enough to keep us in hot water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH GENERALS.</div>

<p>The Government, though safer, are not stronger, and nobody
thinks they can go on very long, though without any
clear idea what is to turn them out, or what is to succeed. It
is pretty generally understood now that Stanley has never had
the least notion of forming a Government, nor even of making
the attempt. Had the event occurred he would have made
a pirouette and whisked off; having done his mischief and
had his fun, he would have considered his work over. It
was very significant that while all the world was fancying
he meditated becoming Prime Minister, he accepted the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
office of Steward of the Jockey Club, to which high dignity
he is this day to be promoted. I told Charles Wood this
the other day, when he said he had never believed Stanley
seriously contemplated being Minister, and that it was clear
there were only two men in the country who could be&mdash;John
Russell and Peel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Peelites are playing an odd game: they
appear to be disengaging themselves from their chief, without
joining the Tories, and they are so conducting themselves
as to make any junction with the Whigs very difficult. It
is never easy to know what Peel himself is <i>at</i>, and what his
real sentiments are. If I may judge from a few words
which dropped from Graham the last time I saw him, he
and Peel (who are man and wife politically) are provoked
with their followers and resent their conduct. What he
said was something about 'letting them see the consequences
of their insubordination,' or some such expressions. It was
the <i>tone</i> in which it was said that struck me. I do not know
to which of them they were meant especially to apply, but
I suppose to Lincoln and Sidney Herbert.</p>

<p>Brougham told me yesterday that he had been to see
Louis Philippe, who had described to him the military men
who are now ruling France. He said Cavaignac was a brave
and good soldier who had been very rapidly promoted, that
he was a downright but honest Republican. When he went
with the King's sons to Algiers, he told them, he would serve
their father with fidelity, but not from conviction, for his
sentiments were republican. He is not a man of great
ability; Bedeau, Lamoricière, and Changarnier are all abler
men, but they are thoroughly imbued with ideas of military
despotism. Everybody believes that the late Government
connived at the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="riot">émeute</i>. Gabriel Delessert told me it was
impossible such preparations could be made, and that they
should be so organised and abundantly provided without
the knowledge of the police.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Endsleigh,</i><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"><span class="label">61</span></a>
<i>July 14th.</i>&mdash;I escaped from the '<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="smoke and noise in Rome">fumum
strepitumque Rom&aelig;</span>,' from racing and politics, on Monday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
last, and came down with De Mauley to this place. We
have passed four days here pleasantly enough; it is exquisitely
beautiful, so is the country round about it; a
mass of comfort and luxury; house perfection, and everything
kept as English houses alone are. This place was a
creation of the Duke's. The house, which is a cottage, cost
between 70,000<i>l.</i> and 80,000<i>l.</i>, and the grounds, laid out with
inimitable taste, must have cost thousands more. There
are sixty miles of grass rides and gravel walks. Yesterday
we went to see a farmhouse, once one of the hunting seats
of the Abbot of Tavistock, a great man whose ample domains
were granted to the Earl of Bedford, who was gorged with
ecclesiastical spoils here and at Woburn. We then went to
see the great copper mine discovered three or four years ago,
the best and most profitable in the West of England. The
ground was leased three and a half years ago to certain adventurers,
who covenanted to give the Duke one-fifteenth of
the <i>gross</i> produce; and as soon (if ever) as they made 30,000<i>l.</i>
a year from it, one-twelfth. After some fruitless attempts they
came upon this lode very near the surface, and found it of
the best copper. A fortune was made <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="immediately">instanter</i>. The shares
were at one time worth 700,000<i>l.</i>, i.e. 700<i>l.</i> apiece; since
that there has been a great fall, but they are now worth
200<i>l.</i> apiece. The expense of working is, however, so much
increased, that the Duke's agent told me he got nearly one-half
the <i>net</i> profits. All this country is full of copper, but
the Duke told me he was resolved not to grant any more
leases for mining, although he had applications every day
and could make a great deal of money by giving them; but
he does not want the money, and he is averse to promote the
spirit of gambling, which money speculations very generally
excite among the people, often greatly to their loss and
always to the detriment of the agriculture of the country;
the latter is neglected for the chances of the former; the
farmers let their carts and horses to the miners instead of
employing them on their own farms; and though mining is
both a profitable and a popular employment, the Duke deems
it so mischievous that he will not suffer any more of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
ground to be broken up for the chance of the copper that
may be found underneath it. I have not heard a word here
in the way of politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TOUR IN DEVONSHIRE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, July 21st.</i>&mdash;Left Endsleigh on Saturday and went
to Plymouth; received by two Admirals to whom Auckland
recommended us, and we saw everything&mdash;the breakwater,
the new docks, a magnificent work, and Mount Edgecumbe.
On Sunday, after church, went on board the 'Caledonia'
(120), and visited every part of the ship; then to the citadel,
the whole thing well worth seeing. On Sunday afternoon
went on to Exeter; in the morning saw the Cathedral and
went to church; a beautiful choir, church handsome inside,
poor in monuments. Then De Mauley and I separated. I
went to Wells; was delighted with the Cathedral and with
the Bishop's palace. On Tuesday to John Thynne's parsonage,
Walton, near Glastonbury; on Wednesday returned
to town, having seen a great deal and passed the time very
agreeably.</p>

<p>When I got here, found that Clarendon, whose arrival
had been announced to me, and who was to have come on
Monday, had been obliged to give up coming in consequence
of the threatening aspect of affairs in Ireland, and he himself
writes word that he does not think an outbreak can be
prevented.<a href="#Footnote_62" id="FNanchor_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
The disgust felt here at the state of Ireland
and the incurable madness of the people, constantly worked
upon by the agitators, is now so great that most people
appear to think the sooner the collision takes place the
better, and that nothing is now left to be done but to fight
it out and reconquer the country. I have certainly arrived
at a conviction that no political measures can now avail to
restore peace and to cement the Union, which in point of fact
only now exists in name. There is no union for any of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
real purposes of a union. What makes the Irish question,
the more dreadful is that the potatoes are again failing, and
starvation will be the inevitable lot of the people. In that
emergency, when it arrives, the Irish will look in vain to
England, for no subscriptions or parliamentary grants or
aid of any sort, public or private, will they get; the sources
of charity and benevolence are dried up; the current which
flowed last year has been effectually checked by the brutality
and ingratitude of the people, and the rancorous fury and
hatred with which they have met our exertions to serve
them. The prospect, neither more nor less than that of civil
war and famine, is dreadful, but it is unavoidable.</p>

<p>John Russell gave notice the other night of the measures
he meant to go on with, and those he meant to abandon;
nobody expected anything more, so no great complaints were
made. The Government is safe enough, but they fall more
and more into discredit. There has been a blunder about the
sugar duties, which makes Ministers look ridiculous, and it is
in fact the constant repetition of small things which damages
their credit, and makes them so miserably weak. The funds
have been rapidly rising and trade improving little by little,
but this Irish affair has checked the rise and produced alarm.
Then the potatoes are failing in England, and we have every
chance of low prices of agricultural produce without abundance,
and if this should happen we shall have an unquiet
winter. So far as I can form an opinion from what I heard
in my tour, the state of the country is not satisfactory.
Chartism seems to increase, and the masses, the operatives in
villages, are restless, ill-disposed, and want they know not
what. It is a great evil that while education is sufficiently
diffused to enable most people to read, they get either from
inclination or convenience nothing but the most mischievous
publications, which only serve to poison their minds, to render
them discontented, and teach them to look to all sorts of
wild schemes as calculated to better their position. The best
part of the press (the 'Times,' for instance) seldom finds its
way to the cottages and reading-rooms of the lower classes,
who are fed by the cheap Radicalism of the 'Weekly Dispatch,'
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and other journals, unknown almost to the higher classes of
society, which are darkly working to undermine the productions
of our social and political system. The lessons of
experience which might be so well taught by the events now
passing in France and elsewhere, are not presented to the
minds of the people in a manner suggestive of wholesome
inferences, but on the contrary they are only used as stimulants
and for purposes of misrepresentation and perversion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRONG MEASURES IN IRELAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>July 22nd.</i>&mdash;Last night Lord John Russell gave notice of
a Bill to enable the Lord Lieutenant to apprehend any suspected
persons, and Lord Lansdowne did the same in the
House of Lords. Lord Lansdowne made a very animated
speech, but it was impossible not to think that all he said
and was going to do might as well have been said and done
long ago. Brougham said as much; Stanley spoke very
well; and the announcement was hailed with universal satisfaction.
It would have been still better in my opinion if
they had suspended the Habeas Corpus at once.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 24th.</i>&mdash;The House of Commons was wonderful on
the 22nd; nobody had the least idea of it, not the Cabinet.
It was an inspiration of John Russell's; he began by making
an excellent speech, an hour and a half. When they divided
he made a speech in the lobby, begged the people not to go
away, and said he meant to propose to go on with the Bill.
To his own amazement as much as anybody's, he found no
opposition, and carried the Bill through at the sitting. By
seven o'clock it was completed and he was on his way to
Richmond, where I dined with him. He was in high spirits;
Sheil and Ward were there, and we talked over the payment
of the priests, which we all agreed (Lord John included)
must be soon done, or at least attempted. Yesterday was
spent in searching for precedents, to see if it was possible
to pass the Bill to-day through the Lords. The Chancellor,
Duke of Wellington, and others, said it was impossible, as
notice must be given of the suspension of the Standing
Orders. Lord Lansdowne said if only <i>one</i> precedent could
be found he would take it, and carry the Bill through; but
if not, they must wait till to-morrow. I should have <i>made</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
the precedent: a more fitting occasion could not be. However,
what was done in the House of Commons will infallibly
produce all the effect that is required, and will strike terror
into the Irish rebels. It was a great event, for which neither
the Lord Lieutenant nor anybody in Ireland will have been
the least prepared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OUTBREAK AT BALLINGARRY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>July 31st.</i>&mdash;At Goodwood all last week, but I found no
time to write or do anything there. The day after we
arrived we were startled by the intelligence of the rebellion
in Ireland having actually broken out; it was not, however,
believed, and turned out to be a mere hoax.<a href="#Footnote_63" id="FNanchor_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Instead of
breaking out, it has not shown a symptom of vitality, and
all the swaggering and boasting and the dreadful threats
and exhibition of physical force have absolutely shrunk into
nothing and evaporated before the formidable preparations
and determined attitude of the Government. The leaders
are skulking about nobody knows where; the clubs are either
suppressed or self-dissolved; the people exhibit no disposition
to rise; the sound and fury which were echoed and
re-echoed from the clubs and meetings, and through the
traitorous press, have been all at once silenced. The whole
thing is suddenly become so contemptible as to be almost
ridiculous. My own conviction was that there would be
no outbreak; but I did not contemplate that all these
mighty preparations, this club organisation and universal
arming would all at once dwindle into nothingness and
general submission just as easily as the Chartist demonstrations
did here some weeks ago; but so it is, and it is
now pretty clear that in a short time Ireland will be just
as quiet and submissive as if Conciliation Hall had never
existed. The most satisfactory part of the business is the
good conduct of the Catholic clergy, who appear to have
very generally used their influence over the people to deter
them from their rebellious courses. It is to be hoped that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the recollection of their behaviour on this trying occasion
will have a considerable effect in paving the way for the
payment of the Irish clergy, when that vital question comes
on, as very soon it must. George Grey declared himself
in favour of it in a speech which he made on Saturday
last, and it is clear that as soon as Ireland is thoroughly
pacified, this question must be regularly taken up by the
Government, and in spite of all the opposition which pride,
prejudice, and bigotry will throw in its way, it must be
forced through. It seems at first sight as if the best thing
which could happen was the bloodless suppression of this talking
rebellion, but I am not sure that it would not have been
better in the end if the leaders had succeeded in bringing
together a body of insurgents, and if a signal chastisement
and ignominious dispersion of them had taken place. There
would be a great advantage in letting them see the fearful
consequences of a collision, and as far as England is concerned,
the people of this country would be better disposed
to clemency and conciliation after they had severely punished
the Irish for their turbulence and folly. As matters are,
though there will be no outbreak, no bloodshed, and an
easy triumph, it will leave the great chronic disease of the
country just where it was; the disaffection, the hatred of
the Union, the enmity to law, will remain the same; the
people will be subdued but not reconciled; and these feelings
will be the stronger because the distress will be greater than
ever. No country can be so shaken to pieces without enormous
distress to the masses; and if the potato crop again
fails (as it has threatened to do) the misery will be appalling
and irremediable. By what has passed and is still passing,
England will not be softened towards Ireland, but contempt
will be added to resentment.</p>

<p>Clarendon will, I take it, have been astonished at the
result corresponding so little with the beginnings of this
Irish manifestation. He evidently considered an outbreak
as imminent and almost certain. The Duke of Bedford
showed me a letter from him which he received at Goodwood,
bitterly complaining of the Government for not having at an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
earlier period furnished him with the powers he demanded,
and saying that though he had repeatedly asked both John
Russell and George Grey to do so, they never would. He
said he had never to any human being disclosed what had
passed between himself and the Government on this matter,
but he evidently feels deeply hurt both at their not attending
to his request, and at the blame of stronger and earlier
measures not having been applied for, being thrown upon
him. It is certainly true that the Government have allowed
it to be believed that they have all along been ruled by his
advice, and that they have done at each successive stage of
the business all that he desired. Even Lord Lansdowne in
the House of Lords the other night declared that there had
been the most perfect agreement all along between the
Government and the Lord Lieutenant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THIRD DUKE OF PORTLAND.</div>

<p>I dined at Holland House yesterday, and sat next to old
Sir Robert Adair, eighty-five years old, but with mind very
fresh. He lived in great intimacy with all the 'great of old,
who still rule our spirits from their own,' and I believe possesses
a great store of anecdotes of bygone days. He gave me
an account of young Burke's preventing the reconciliation
between his father and Fox, which, however, is too well known
to require repetition; but he told me how the Duke of Portland<a href="#Footnote_64" id="FNanchor_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
came to be put at the head of the Whig party on the
death of Lord Rockingham in 1782, which I had not heard
before. There was a meeting of the party to choose their
chief; the Duke of Richmond put forth his pretensions, but
he was so great a Radical (having views of Parliamentary
Reform not only far beyond those of any man of that day,
but beyond the Reform we have actually got), that they
were afraid of him; and Charles Fox got up and said that
he thought he, as leader of the House of Commons, had
claims at least as good as the Duke of Richmond's, but that
they ought both of them to waive their own claims, and in
his judgement the man they ought to place at their head was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
the Duke of Portland. This compromise was agreed to, but
the Duke of Richmond was so disgusted that he joined Lord
Shelburne. My grandfather was a very honourable, high-minded,
but ordinary man; his abilities were very second-rate,
and he had no power of speaking; and his election to
the post of leader of the great Whig party only shows how
aristocratic that party was, and what weight and influence
the aristocracy possessed in those days; they would never
have endured to be led by a Peel or a Canning. Adair told
me that old Lord George Cavendish expressed the greatest
indignation at their party being led by Burke in the House
of Commons, and it was this prevalent feeling, together with
the extraordinary modesty of Burke, who had no vanity for
himself, though a great deal for his son, which accounts for
the fact, so extraordinary according to our ideas and practice,
that though Burke led the Whig party in the House of
Commons for four or five years, when that party came into
power he was not offered a place in the Cabinet, but put in a
subordinate office, which he condescended to accept, seeing
men so immeasurably inferior to himself occupying the
highest posts.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>August 5th.</i>&mdash;In Ireland there has hardly been a semblance
of resistance; flight and terror and sulky submission
have been the order of the day. Meanwhile the military
preparations and arrangements have not been relaxed, and
the arrests have been multiplied. Hitherto the search for
O'Brien and the other leaders has been fruitless, and it is
currently reported that the former has escaped; letters have
been written with detailed accounts of his escape, but this
is believed to be only a trick to facilitate it. The rebellion
is effectually suppressed, but the state of Ireland is lamentable,
and a great and long futurity of difficulties and evils
may be expected. Very few arms have been taken; they are
all hid by the peasantry, to be drawn forth when occasion
offers itself.</p>

<p>Brougham in the House of Lords delivered a flaming
panegyric on Hardinge's patriotism in going to Ireland, and
the Duke of Wellington's wisdom in appointing him; but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
real truth is that he was selected for this post by the Queen
and Lord John Russell, without the knowledge and not
entirely to the satisfaction of the Duke. Hardinge himself,
though he evinced a proper readiness and immediately consented
to go, begged he might be released as soon as possible.
Arbuthnot told the Duke of Bedford that it was a pity Lord
John had not consulted the Duke about sending Hardinge,
instead of only telling him after it was settled, which sufficiently
shows the Duke's feeling; and Clarendon, though
he made no objection, evidently did not like it. If they
had known how little there would be to do, he probably
would not have been sent to Ireland at all. The Duke does
not think very highly of Hardinge's military talents. The
two men whom he places his confidence in are Sir Charles
Napier and Sir Harry Smith; he was asked the question,
and this was his answer; and moreover he thinks that on
one occasion in India Hardinge committed a dangerous
military blunder which Gough repaired; whereas all the
world believes that Gough, though a very brave soldier, was
a very inefficient commander, and that to Hardinge was
attributable the success of the Sikh campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SIKH CAMPAIGN.</div>

<p>The true history of that campaign is as yet little known,
but whenever it is fairly put before the world it will exhibit
one of the most striking and extraordinary examples of the
chances and accidents on which the fate of empires depend
that has ever been recorded. I have often heard that the
events of those Sikh battles were very precarious, but it was
only the other day that I heard on what a marvellous accident
the last great battle depended. Hardinge considered
the battle lost, and the destruction of his army inevitable.
Not expecting to survive the defeat, he gave his watch and
some other things about him to one of his officers, desiring
him to have them conveyed to his wife, with the assurance
that his last thoughts were with her. At this juncture a
staff officer (whose name I did not hear), who from nervousness
or fear had lost his head, went to the commander of our
cavalry, and told him that he was the bearer of an order to
him to retire; that officer asked if he had no written order,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
he said he had not, but he spoke so positively as to the instruction
with which he was charged, that the other believed
him and began to draw off his men. This movement was
seen by the Sikhs, and, mistaking its purport, they fancied
it indicated a disposition to take them in flank and cut off
their communications. They were seized with a sudden
panic, and immediately commenced their retreat: it was
thus that this victory was won when it was all but lost, and
won by the mistake or the invention of an officer who in
terror or confusion had communicated an order which never
was given to him, and which he had himself invented or
imagined. It is universally agreed that if we had been defeated
in that action our Eastern Empire would have been
lost to us, for the prestige of our power would have been lost,
and all India would have risen to cast off our yoke. After
the action the question arose how this officer was to be dealt
with, but it was not considered prudent to bring him to a
court-martial, when the consequences of his conduct had
been such as they were, and the inquiry might have revealed
the magnitude of the peril from which we had escaped.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>August 8th.</i>&mdash;At Latimers from Saturday till Monday.
Called on Wriothesley Russell at Chenies, and Lady Wriothesley
told me that there is not far off a Chartist establishment;
a society of Chartists located and living on land
bought by Chartist subscriptions; a sort of communist society.
It has existed some years, but is now falling into decay.
Feargus O'Connor spoke to Charles Russell about it, and said
he wished his brother would take some notice of them, <i>for
they liked to be noticed by people of rank</i>; and, he added,
'Collectively they are with me, but individually they are
with you.' In these words a great lesson and significant fact
are contained well worth attention.</p>

<p>On arriving in town yesterday found the news of Smith
O'Brien's capture, which some think a good thing and some
a bad one; some say he is mad, some are for hanging him,
some for transporting, others for letting him go; in short,
<i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="every man had his sentence">quot homines tot sententiæ</i>. He is a good-for-nothing, conceited,
contemptible fellow, who has done a great deal of

mischief and deserves to be hung, but it will probably be
very difficult to convict him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CLARENDON'S POLICY IN IRELAND.</div>

<p>Thence to Nuneham, a charming place, and on Monday
to London. I heard an anecdote at Nuneham which was
new to me: Harcourt gave it on the authority of Sir Robert
Peel. He said that when the discussion took place about
the East Retford question during the Duke of Wellington's
Government, <i>in the Cabinet</i> Peel was for giving the representation
to one of the great towns, and Huskisson against
it; that Peel was overruled by a majority of his colleagues
and consequently took the part he did in Parliament; while
Huskisson was induced to change his opinion and to take in
Parliament the opposite line from that which he had taken
in the Cabinet; he and Peel, in fact, both changing sides.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
His colleagues were naturally very indignant with Huskisson,
and this accounts for the bitterness which the Duke of Wellington
evinced, and for his celebrated 'No mistake.' This
seemed to me a strange story, though some people there
wondered I had never heard it before. If it be true, it is
equally discreditable to both Peel and Huskisson; in the
former it was both a fault and a crime; it was a great error
in judgement and very wrong in itself.</p>

<p>I found a letter from Clarendon when I got to town,
telling me he had been 'much bothered by the vacillation and
timidity of our rulers on this occasion as on the preceding
ones, when I was compelled to insist on further power for
the protection of life and the maintenance of law and order.
It is not pleasant to have to poke a Cabinet into a sense of
duty, or to extract by threats as if for a personal favour
that which should be readily acceded to when the public
necessity for it was proved and manifest. However, that
has been my task, and I don't much care if the thing is
achieved and nobody knows it.... Against the clubs a law
of some kind was necessary. No one could doubt that,
and so I insisted, making <i>for the third time</i> my remaining
here conditional upon it. So they succumbed, but not
with a good grace.' All along the Government have been
afraid to adopt a vigorous and decided course, and have been
fencing with Clarendon, who has insisted on it. The consequences
of endeavouring to make the law work are now
apparent in the failure of the first of the trials. It is trying
to make bricks without straw; the people will not work the
machinery of the law, but, on the contrary, abhor and will
oppose the law itself; everybody sees that and still the
Government do not dare openly say so, and adopt the measures
that are necessary to cope with the difficulty. There was an
excellent article in the 'Morning Chronicle' yesterday in this
sense. I pointed it out to Lord Lansdowne, who expressed
his concurrence with it. However, for the present
I believe Clarendon is in possession of power enough to keep
the country in order. He can imprison everybody and put
down the clubs by so doing, but he will never be able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
obtain convictions. Indeed, it would probably be better they
should all fail at first than have one succeed every now and
then, just enough to prevent their having recourse to another
system.</p>

<p>The brilliant success of the Austrians and the disgraceful
termination of Charles Albert's campaign<a href="#Footnote_67" id="FNanchor_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> has
produced a fresh interest in foreign affairs and great anxiety
as to the result of the offered mediation of England and
France. Palmerston's conduct throughout the Milanese
war has been very extraordinary, but I will pronounce no
positive opinion on it till I am better informed of all the
hidden circumstances in which the question has been involved.
What appears is this: some time ago the Austrians
invited our mediation, sent Hummelauer over here for that
purpose, and were prepared to make great sacrifices to settle
the question. Palmerston refused; he thought the Austrian
cause was irretrievably ruined, that all Italy would be lost
to them, and he wished that result to take place. Old
Radetzky <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="delaying the matter">cunctando restituit rem</i>, and the tide of war was on
a sudden victoriously rolled back, and the King of Sardinia
completely baffled. Then Palmerston stepped in with his
offer of mediation when there were no longer any parties to
mediate between, or matters to mediate about, losing sight
of his own conduct in the Swiss affair, when after the defeat
of the Sunderbund he declared that the quarrel was decided
and no mediation was necessary. He is now on the best
possible terms with Cavaignac, and acting cordially with
France. Cavaignac seems to have behaved with great
frankness and good sense; he sent M. de Beaumont here
with the most amicable professions;<a href="#Footnote_68" id="FNanchor_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> he said that his object
was to preserve peace, did not attempt to disguise the fact
of the deplorable state of his finances, and the great object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
it therefore was to abstain from war; but he appears to have
assumed that the honour of France was in some way concerned
in delivering by fair means or foul the Milanese from
the Austrian yoke. How far Palmerston has admitted this
pretension remains to be seen, and we do not yet know
whether he has come to an understanding with France as to
what is to be done by her in the event of the joint mediation
being declined; whether or no he has tacitly or expressly
assented to the invasion of Italy by the French, and their
making war on Austria to expel her from Lombardy. It
would hardly appear possible that he should have done so, if
it were not for his conduct in reference to Naples and Sicily,
for if it turns out to be true that the British Admiral is
ordered to prevent the King of Naples from making any
attempt to reconquer Sicily, he cannot object to the French
Government's interfering in the affairs of the North of Italy.
But if the Austrians reject the mediation (as they probably
will), and Cavaignac sends an army across the Alps with our
connivance and consent, we shall not play a very dignified
part, and I question if such policy will find general acceptance
here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEDIATION IN ITALY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>August 20th.</i>&mdash;On Wednesday night Disraeli made a very
brilliant speech on foreign affairs in the House of Commons,
and Palmerston a very able reply which was received with
great applause and admiration. It was, however, only a
simulated contest between them; for Dizzy, while pretending
to attack Palmerston with much fire and fury, did not in
reality touch him on difficult points. In reference to the
mediation, Palmerston had with his usual good luck received
on the morning of the debate a communication from the
Austrian Minister stating the desire of his Court to avail
itself of our mediation, which he employed with great
effect. His speech was certainly very dexterous, and all
the more so because he contrived to glide undetected over
the weak points, and to satisfy the House of Commons without
giving them any information whatever.</p>

<p>All the people who come from Paris represent the state
of affairs there and in France in a curious light. The tranquillity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
is complete, the submission general, and there is
little probability of any fresh outbreak, none of a successful
one. The Republic is universally despised, detested, and
ridiculed, but no other form of Government and no Pretender
is in much favour or demanded by public feeling
or inclination. They hate the Republic because they are
conscious that the Revolution which turned France into
one has inflicted enormous evils upon them. The best
chance at the present moment seems to me to be that of
the Duc de Bordeaux, Henry V., not because anybody cares
about <i>him</i>, for he is almost unknown in France, and what is
known of him does not make him an object of interest
to Frenchmen, nor (what is by no means unimportant) to
Frenchwomen; but he represents a principle, and there still
lingers in many parts of France, and reigns in some, a sentiment
of attachment and loyalty to the elder branch and the
legitimate cause. This gives him a chance, but nobody
seems to have any idea what sort of monarchy could be
restored, if to a monarchy the French eventually recur.
But I was told last night by Bulwer, who is just come from
Paris, a fact which if it be true is of great importance,
namely, that there has sprung up in France a great respect
for station and position, a sentiment that did not exist
before, indicating a revolution in the minds of men of a
very reactionary and beneficial character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRISH DISAFFECTION AND REMEDIES.</div>

<p>Bessborough, who is just come back from Ireland, brings
a very bad account of the state of the country, and Clarendon
seems to have talked to him very openly upon all matters
connected with Irish administration, and the views and conduct
of the Government here. Though the rebellion is put
down, the whole animus of the people is as bad as ever; they
brood over their defeats, and only long for revenge and
action at some future time. The outbreak was within an
ace of taking place, and seems to have been prevented by an
accident and by the pusillanimity or prudence of the clubs.
They had established a very perfect club organisation and
were in a state of great preparation, but had resolved not to
rise till September. When the suspension of the Habeas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Corpus was proposed, Smith O'Brien and the other leaders
saw that they must proceed to action instantly or that they
should be taken up, and they proceeded to Carrick, addressed
the people, and asked them if they were ready; they
said they were, but the clubs must be consulted; he sent to
the clubs, but a small body of troops having marched into
Carrick the same day, the clubs were intimidated and refused
their consent to the rising. This put an extinguisher on
the whole thing; if the clubs had consented many thousands
would have poured down from the hills, and the country
would everywhere have been up. He says Clarendon does
everything in Ireland himself, and directs judges, law-officers,
commander-in-chief, stipendiary magistrates, police
constables&mdash;his work enormous. He wants to come over
here that he may see the Cabinet collectively and explain
his own views and opinions; he is evidently disgusted to the
greatest degree at the impossibility of getting them to move
out of the beaten track, and face the difficulties of the case
by measures of a decisive character.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>September 5th.</i>&mdash;On Saturday to the Grange, where Charles
Buller showed me a paper he has drawn up with suggestions
of measures for Ireland, which are very sound and good on
the whole, though I do not know that I should agree as to
all the details. He proposes strong government, abolition
of jury unanimity in criminal cases, emigration on a large
scale&mdash;particularly to the Cape of Good Hope, and the constitution
of a Board of employment and cultivation, who are
to borrow money and invest it just as an individual capitalist
might do. He adds to this, payment of the Catholic clergy
by funds to be raised in Ireland, not asking imperial aid nor
touching the Protestant Church; he only allots to this purpose
350,000<i>l.</i>, not enough. He very justly says, however,
that unless Government do something bold, new, comprehensive,
and on a great scale, they will incur disgrace and
ultimately ruin.</p>

<p>We had a Council yesterday for the parting Speech, and
to-day this long session, the longest and most tedious ever
known, closes. On Wednesday last, Disraeli with a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
flourish of trumpets and note of preparation delivered an
oration <i>à la</i> Lyndhurst, of three hours long, to which John
Russell made a pretty good reply. Dizzy's speech was very
sparkling and clever, but it was, after all, nothing but a
theatrical display, without object or meaning but to show off
his own powers. It was prefaced by a sort of advertisement
that the great actor would take his benefit that morning on
the stage of St. Stephen's; an audience was collected, and
he sent word to Delane that he was going to speak in order
that he might have one of his best reporters there. He
quizzed Charles Wood unmercifully, and showed up a good
many of the blunders and really stupid things which the
Government did in the course of the session.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>September 22nd.</i>&mdash;No sooner was Parliament up than
every creature took flight, and London became more empty
and deserted than ever I saw it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD GEORGE BENTINCK.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>September 28th.</i>&mdash;I was about to record my own proceedings
and such other scraps as occurred to me, when my mind
was diverted from all other topics by the intelligence of the
death of George Bentinck.<a href="#Footnote_69" id="FNanchor_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> This event was so strange and
sudden, that it could not fail to make a very great sensation
in the world, and so it did. It would be false and hypocritical
were I to pretend that it affected me personally with
any feeling of affliction, but I can say with truth that I was
much shocked, and that I was sincerely sorry for it. I was
sorry for the heavy blow thus inflicted on his father and his
family, and it was impossible not to regard with compassion
and something of regret the sudden termination of a career
which promised to be one of no small prosperity and success.
He was in truth a very remarkable man, of very singular
character and disposition, and his history is one very much
out of the common way. I am in one respect better, and
in another worse, fitted to describe him than any other
person, for nobody knew him so intimately and so well as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
once did, nobody is so well acquainted with his most private
thoughts and feelings as well as with his most secret practices;
but, on the other hand, I should never be deemed an
impartial biographer of a man from whom I had been so
long and completely estranged, and between whom and myself
there existed such strong feelings of alienation and
dislike. Nevertheless, I will try to describe him as I think
he really was, nothing extenuating, and nothing setting
down in malice. The world will and must form a very incorrect
estimate of his character; more of what was good
than of what was bad in it was known to the public; he
had the credit of virtues which he did not possess, or which
were so mixed with vices that if all had been known he
would have been most severely reproached in reference to the
matters in which he has been the most loudly and generally
bepraised; but his was one of those composite characters,
in which opposite qualities, motives, and feelings were so
strangely intermingled that nothing but a nice analysis, a
very close and impartial inspection of it, can do him justice.
His memory has been kindly and generously dealt with; he
was on the whole high in favour with the world; he had
been recently rising in public estimation; and his sudden and
untimely end has stifled all feelings but those of sympathy
and regret, and silenced all voices but those of eulogy and
lamentation. He has long been held up as the type and
model of all that is most honourable and high-minded;
'<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="passionate, ruthless, fierce">iracundus, inexorabilis, acer</span>,' indeed, but the lofty and incorruptible
scorner of everything mean and dishonourable,
and the stern exposer and scourger of every species of delinquency
and fraud, public or private. Oh for the inconsistency
of human nature, the strange compound and medley
of human motives and impulses, when the same man who
crusaded against the tricks and villanies of others did not
scruple to do things quite as bad as the worst of the misdeeds
which he so vigorously and unrelentingly attacked!
But it is only possible to make his character intelligible by
a reference to certain passages of his life, especially to his
transactions and connexions with myself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>He was brought up at home under a private tutor, was not
studious in early life, and very soon entered the army. I do
not remember whether he went to a public school. He soon
distinguished himself in the army by his great spirit and
courage, and by that arrogance which was his peculiar characteristic,
and which never deserted him in any situation or
circumstance in which he was placed. I well remember his
getting into a quarrel which would have led to a duel, if his
father had not got me to go to the Duke of York, by whose
interposition the hostile collision was prevented.<a href="#Footnote_70" id="FNanchor_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> I have,
however, forgotten both the name of his antagonist and the
merits of the case. He very soon quitted the army, and
when Mr. Canning became Prime Minister he made George
his private secretary. It has been said that Canning predicted
great things of him if he would apply himself seriously
to politics, but I do not know whether this is true. It is
certain that after Canning's death, although by no means
indifferent to public affairs, he took no active or prominent
part in them, and the first development of his great
natural energy took place in a very different field. He fell
desperately in love, and he addicted himself with extraordinary
vivacity to the turf. At this time and for a
great many years we were most intimate friends, and I was
the depositary of his most secret thoughts and feelings.
This passion, the only one he ever felt for any woman,
betrayed him into great imprudence of manner and behaviour,
so much so, that I ventured to put him on his guard.
I cannot now say when this occurred, it is so long ago, but I
well recollect that as I was leaving&mdash;&mdash;after the races
I took him aside, told him it was not possible to be blind to
his sentiments, that he was exposing himself and her likewise;
that I did not mean to thrust myself into his confidence
in so delicate a matter, but besought him to remember
that all eyes were on him, all tongues ready to talk,
and that it behoved him to be more guarded and reserved
for her sake as well as his own. He made no reply, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
departed, I think I repeated the same thing to him in a
letter; but whether I did or no, I received from him a very
long one in which he confessed his sentiments without disguise,
went at great length into his own case, declared his
inability to sacrifice feelings which made the whole interest
of his existence, but affirmed with the utmost solemnity that
he had no reason to believe his feelings were reciprocated by
her, and that not only did he not aspire to <i>success</i>, but that
if it were in his power to obtain it (which he knew it was
not), he would not purchase his own gratification at the
expense of her honour and happiness; in short, his letter
amounted to this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Let me but visit her, I'll ask no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Guiltless I'll gaze, and innocent adore.'</span>
</span></p>
</div>

<p>I allude to this to show the terms of intimacy on which
he and I were, and likewise to do justice to the purity
and unselfishness of his devotion, for I am certain that all
he said to me was true. He was, however, not of a very
warm temperament, and this may perhaps materially diminish
the virtue and the value of his high-flown and self-immolating
sentiments; but let them pass for what they are worth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF LORD GEORGE BENTINCK.</div>

<p>The first time I ever knew him much occupied with
politics was during the great Reform battles in 1831 and
1832, when he was member for Lynn. He took much the
same views that I did, and was very anxious to modify the
Reform Bill and render it a less Radical measure. The
people of Lynn wanted a member and commissioned him to
find one, and he exerted himself greatly for that purpose.
By his desire I applied to Kindersley, then a man of some
eminence at the Chancery bar, but he declined. I remember
that he and his father did not coincide in their opinions.
The Duke was frightened out of his wits, dreaded the loss
of his vast property, and thought that the only safe policy
was unconditional submission to the roar for Reform. Hating
the measure in his heart, he was against any endeavour to
arrest its progress; and he was not at all pleased with
George for the part which he took. The latter, however, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
do him justice, was never afraid of anybody or anything;
and he sturdily but deferentially adhered to his own opinion
in opposition to the Duke's. Meanwhile, he constantly
attended Newmarket, and it was not long before he began
to have horses of his own, running them, however, in my
name. The first good racehorse he possessed was 'Preserve,'
which I bought for him in 1833, and she, alas! was the
cause of our first quarrel, that which was made up in appearance,
but in reality never. Of course in this quarrel (which
took place in August 1835) we both thought ourselves in
the right. Till then not an unkind word had ever passed
between us, nor had a single cloud darkened our habitual
intercourse; but on this occasion I opposed and thwarted
him, and his resentment broke out against me with a vehemence
and ferocity that perfectly astounded me, and displayed
in perfection the domineering insolence of his character. I
knew he was out of humour, but had no idea that he meant
to quarrel with me, and thought his serenity would speedily
return. I wrote to him as usual, and to my astonishment
received one of his most elaborate epistles, couched in terms
so savage and so virulently abusive, imputing to me conduct
the most selfish and dishonourable, that I knew not on reading
it whether I stood on my head or my heels. I was
conscious that his charges and insinuations were utterly
groundless, but what was I to do? I could not tamely
endure such gross and unwarrantable insults, and I could
not challenge my uncle's son. In this dilemma I consulted
a friend, and placed the letter in his hands; he went to him,
and (not I believe without great difficulty) he persuaded him
to <i>ask</i> to withdraw it. It was agreed that the letter should
be destroyed, and that there should be no ostensible quarrel
between us; but it was evident that our turf connexion
could no longer subsist, and accordingly it was instantly
dissolved, and other arrangements were made for his stud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RACING RECOLLECTIONS.</div>

<p>Then commenced his astounding career of success on the
turf; he soon enlarged the sphere of his speculations, increased
his establishment, and ultimately transferred it all
to John Day at Danebury, where he trained under all sorts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
of different names, it being a great object with him to keep
his father in ignorance of his proceedings.<a href="#Footnote_71" id="FNanchor_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> He and I met
upon civil but cool terms, according to the agreement; but
in about two years we began to jumble into intimacy again,
and at length an incident happened which in great measure
replaced our relations on their former footing. My horse
Mango was in the St. Leger, and I wanted to try him. John
Day told me he was sure Lord George would gladly try him
for me. I proposed it to him, and he instantly assented.
We went down together and tried the horse. Mango won
his trial, won the St. Leger, and George won 14,000<i>l.</i> on the
race. All this contributed to efface the recollection of past
differences, and we became mutually cordial again.<a href="#Footnote_72" id="FNanchor_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> With
me the reconciliation was sincere. I had forgiven his behaviour
to me, and desired no better than to live in amity with
him for the rest of my life; whether it was equally sincere
on his part he alone knew, but I very much doubt it. We
continued, however, to live very well together up to the time
when he brought out the famous 'Crucifix,' when, without
any fresh quarrel, our intimacy became somewhat less close
in consequence of my perceiving a manifest intention on his
part to keep all the advantage of her merits to himself without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
allowing me to participate in them. Still we went on,
till the occurrence of the notorious 'Gurney affair,' on which
he and I took opposite sides, and in which he played a very
conspicuous and violent part. While this was going on we
were brought into personal collision at Newmarket in a
matter relating to the revision of the rules of the Jockey
Club, when his arrogance and personal animosity to me
broke out with extraordinary asperity. There was still no
regular and avowed quarrel till the spring following, when
at a meeting of the Jockey Club I made a speech in opposition
to him which he chose to construe into an intentional
insult, and the next time he met me he cut me dead. I
made several attempts, as did our mutual friends, to do
away with this impression and to effect a reconciliation,
but he refused to listen to any explanation or overture, and
announced his resolution not to make it up with me at all.
From that time our estrangement was complete and irreparable.
He was now become the leviathan of the turf; his
success had been brilliant, his stud was enormous, and his
authority and reputation were prodigiously great.</p>

<p>In 1844 he became still more famous by his exertions in
detecting the 'Running Rein' fraud, and in conducting the
'Orlando' trial. There can be no doubt that the success of
that affair was in great measure attributable to his indefatigable
activity, ingenuity, and perseverance. The attorney
in the cause was amazed at the ability and dexterity he displayed,
and said there was no sum he would not give to
secure the professional assistance of such a coadjutor. He
gained the greatest credit in all quarters by his conduct
throughout this affair, which was afterwards increased by
his manner of receiving a valuable testimonial, subscribed
for the purpose of honouring and rewarding his exertions:
he refused to accept anything for himself, but desired the
money might be applied towards the establishment of a fund
to reward decayed and distressed servants of the turf, which
was eventually denominated 'The Bentinck Fund.'<a href="#Footnote_73" id="FNanchor_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
exceedingly self-willed and arrogant, and never could endure
contradiction; and whatever he undertook he entered into
with an ardour and determination which amounted to a
passion. As he plunged into gaming on the turf, he desired
to win money, not so much for the money, as because it was
the test and the trophy of success; he counted the thousands
he won after a great race as a general would count his prisoners
and his cannon after a great victory; and his tricks
and stratagems he regarded as the tactics and man&oelig;uvres by
which the success was achieved. Not probably that the money
itself was altogether a matter of indifference to him: he had
the blood of General Scott in his veins, who won half a
million at hazard, and the grandson most likely <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="carried on the family tradition">chassait un
peu de sa race</i>. But to do him justice, if he was '<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="covetous of another's possession">alieni
appetens</span>,' he was '<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="lavish of his own">sui profusus</span>.' Nobody was more liberal
to all his people, nor more generous and obliging in money
matters to his friends, and I am inclined to think that while
he was taking to himself the mission of purifying the turf,
and punishing or expelling wrongdoers of all sorts, his own
mind became purified, and (though I do not know it) I should
not wonder if he looked back with shame and contrition to
all the schemes, plots, and machinations to which, in the
ardour of his racing pursuit, he had been a party. What
makes me think that it was less the base desire of pecuniary
gain than the passionate eagerness of immense success which
urged him on, is the alacrity with which he cast away his
whole stud, at a moment when it promised him the most
brilliant results and most considerable profits, as soon as
another passion and another pursuit had taken possession of
his mind; one in which there was not only no pecuniary
benefit in view, but the occupation of which obliged him to
neglect his turf concerns so entirely that he lost a great deal
of money in consequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GEORGE SELLS HIS STUD.</div>

<p>This brings me to his very extraordinary political career.
I well remember, in the winter of 1845, when Peel's intentions
began to be known or suspected, what indignation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
he expressed and what violent language he used about him.
As soon as Parliament met he began to take an active part
amongst the Protectionist malcontents, and he devoted much
time to getting up the <i>pro</i> Corn Law case. He had never
studied political economy, and knew very little on the subject,
but he was imbued with the notions common to his party that
the repeal of the Corn Laws would be the ruin of the landed
interest; he therefore hated the Anti-Corn Law League,
and&mdash;considering that the first and most paramount of duties
was to keep up the value of the estates of the order to which
he belonged, and that Peel had been made Minister and held
office mainly for this purpose&mdash;he considered Peel's abandonment
of Protection, and adoption, or rather extension, of
Free Trade, as not only an act of treachery, but of treason to
the party which claimed his allegiance, and he accordingly
flung himself into opposition to him with all his characteristic
vehemence and rancour. Still neither he himself nor any one
else anticipated the part he was about to play, and the figure
he was destined to make. One of the men whom he was in
the habit of talking to, was Martin, Q.C.,<a href="#Footnote_74" id="FNanchor_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and he told him
that he had a great mind to speak on the Corn Law debate,
but that he did not think he could; he had had no experience
and could not trust himself.<a href="#Footnote_75" id="FNanchor_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Martin told me this.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
I said I thought he could; that I had been much struck
with a speech he had made at the Jockey Club, when he
had spoken for two hours, and in a way which satisfied me
he had <i>speaking in him</i>. Martin went and told him this,
which struck him very much, and it decided him (so Martin
told me) to make the attempt. His <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> in the House
of Commons was a remarkable exhibition, and made a great
impression at the time: not that it was a very good, still
less an agreeable speech; quite the reverse. He chose the
worst moment he possibly could have done to rise; the
House was exhausted by several nights of debate and had no
mind to hear more. He rose very late on the last night,
and he spoke for above three hours; his speech was ill-delivered,
marked with all those peculiar faults which he
never got rid of; it was very tiresome; it contained much
that was in very bad taste; but in spite of all defects it was
listened to, and it was considered a very extraordinary performance,
giving indications of great ability and powers
which nobody had any idea that he possessed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GEORGE'S POLITICAL CAREER.</div>

<p>The rest of his career is well known. He brought into
politics the same ardour, activity, industry, and cleverness
which he had displayed on the turf, and some of the same
cunning and contrivances too. He never was and never
would have been anything like a statesman; he was utterly
devoid of large and comprehensive views, and he was no
pursuer and worshipper of truth. He brought the mind,
the habits, and the arts of an attorney to the discussion of
political questions; having once espoused a cause, and embraced
a party, from whatever motive, he worked with all
the force of his intellect and a superhuman power of application
in what he conceived to be the interest of that party
and that cause. No scruples, moral or personal, stood for a
moment in his way; he went into evidence, historical or
statistical, not to inform himself and to accept with a candid
and unbiassed mind the conclusions to which reason and
testimony, facts and figures, might conduct him, but to pick
out whatever might fortify his foregone conclusions, casting
aside everything inimical to the cause he was advocating,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
and seizing all that could be turned to account by any
amount of misrepresentation and suppression he might find
it convenient to employ. It was thus he acted in the West
India Committee; his labour and application were something
miraculous; he conducted the enquiry very ably, but
anything but impartially; having had no political education,
and being therefore unimbued with sound principles on
fiscal and commercial questions, he had everything to learn;
and having flung himself headlong into the Protectionist
cause, he got up their case just as he did that of 'Orlando'
or 'Running Rein,' and ran amuck against everything and
everybody on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Against Peel he soon broke out with indescribable fury
and rancour. Such was the attack he made upon him about
his conduct to Canning, which has been since ascribed to his
attachment to the latter, and a long cherished but suppressed
resentment at Peel's behaviour to him. Nothing could be
more ridiculously untrue; he did not care one straw for
Canning, alive or dead, and he did not himself believe one
word of the accusations he brought against Peel; but he
thought he had found materials for a damaging attack on
the man he detested, and he availed himself of it with all the
virulence of the most vindictive hatred. It was a total failure,
and he only afforded Peel an opportunity of vindicating himself
once for all from an imputation which had been very
generally circulated and believed, but which he proved to
be altogether false. The House of Commons gave Peel a
complete triumph, and George Bentinck was generally condemned;
nevertheless, with more courage and bull-dog perseverance
than good taste and judgement, he returned to
the charge, and instead of withdrawing his accusations,
renewed and insisted on them in his reply. This was just
like him; but though his conduct was very ill advised, I
well remember thinking his reply (made too against the
sense and feeling of the House) was very clever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GEORGE'S POPULARITY.</div>

<p>I have always thought that his conduct in selling his
stud all at one swoop, and at once giving up the turf, to
which he had just before seemed so devoted, was never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
sufficiently appreciated and praised. It was a great sacrifice
both of pleasure and profit, and it was made to what
he had persuaded himself was a great public duty. It is
true that he had taken up his new vocation with an ardour
and a zeal which absorbed his old one, but still it was a very
fine act, and excessively creditable to him. He never did
anything by halves, and having accepted the responsible
post of leader of his party, he resolved to devote himself
to their service, and he did so without stint or reserve;
and when he had ceased to be nominally their leader, a
transaction in which his behaviour was honourable and
manly, he still voluntarily and gratuitously imposed upon
himself an amount of labour and anxiety on particular
questions, which beyond all doubt contributed to the accident
which terminated his life. Notwithstanding his arrogance
and his violence, his constant quarrels and the intolerable
language he indulged in, he was popular in the House of
Commons, and was liked more or less wherever he went. He
was extremely good-looking and particularly distinguished
and high-bred; then he was gay, agreeable, obliging, and
good-natured, charming with those he liked, and by whom he
was not thwarted and opposed. His undaunted courage and
the confident and haughty audacity with which he attacked
or stood up against all opponents, being afraid of no man,
inspired a general sentiment of admiration and respect, and
his lofty assumption of superior integrity and his resolute
determination to expose and punish every breach of public
honour and morality were quietly acquiesced in, and treated
with great deference by the multitude who knew no better,
and were imposed on by his specious pretensions. The sensation
caused by his death, the encomiums pronounced on his
character, and the honours paid to his memory, have been
unexampled in a man whose career has been so short, and
who did not do greater things than he had it in his power
to accomplish. He had become, however, the advocate of
powerful interests, and of vast numbers of people whose
united voices make a great noise in the world, and there is
something in the appalling suddenness of the catastrophe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
which excites general sympathy and pity, and makes people
more inclined to think of his virtues, his powers, and his promise,
than of his defects. Of the latter perhaps the greatest
was his constant disposition to ascribe the worst motives to
all those to whom he found himself opposed;</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;</span>
</span></div>

<p>and when he invariably fancied that he saw intentional
fraud and the utmost baseness in the conduct of his antagonists,
it is impossible not to ascribe such false and erroneous
views of human nature to the moral consciousness
which was the result of his own former courses, constantly
suspecting others of the same sort of practices with which
he was once so familiar. I have not the least doubt that,
for his own reputation and celebrity, he died at the most
opportune period; his fame had probably reached its zenith,
and credit was given him for greater abilities than he possessed,
and for a futurity of fame, influence, and power which
it is not probable he ever would have realised. As it is, the
world will never know anything of those serious blemishes
which could not fail to dim the lustre of his character; he
will long be remembered and regretted as a very remarkable
man, and will occupy a conspicuous place in the history of
his own time.

<p class="entry"><i>London, October 20th, 1848.</i>&mdash;One day the week before
last, I dined with D'Orsay to meet Louis Blanc. Nobody
there but he and I. We had a great deal of talk. He is
very gay, animated, and full of information, takes in very
good part anything that is said to him, and any criticisms
on his Revolution and the Provisional Government. After
that, a week at Newmarket, and last week at the Grange
with a large party, agreeable enough. M. Dumon<a href="#Footnote_76" id="FNanchor_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> was
there, and we asked him to explain why the Government of
which he was a member had so obstinately refused to concede
any reform. He gave an explanation and apology for
their conduct, which was not very satisfactory, and amounted
to little more than the old story of the necessity of keeping
together the Conservative majority. Louis Blanc told me
the Revolution had not ruined France; that the ruin was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
already consummated, and the Revolution only tore away
the veil which concealed it.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 7th.</i>&mdash;While I was at Newmarket, Lord Clarendon
came over here, but I never succeeded in seeing him till
yesterday. He is to have the Garter, the Duke of Leinster and
Lord Fitzwilliam having both refused it, and he wished to
refuse it also, but Lord John made a point of his taking it. A
Committee of Cabinet is appointed to consider Irish measures,
but I see very clearly that no attempt will be made to pay
the priests; and though I have not changed my opinion as
to the measure itself, I am disposed to think that at this
time it could not be attempted with any chance of success.
While everything else is in a constant state of change,
Protestant bigotry and anti-Catholic rancour continue to
flourish with undiminished intensity, and all the more from
being founded on nothing but prejudice and ignorance,
without a particle of sense and reason.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 11th.</i>&mdash;George Bentinck's servant called on
me the other morning, and told me that he had a strong
impression his Lord would have soon thrown up politics
and taken to racing again as suddenly as he took to the
former; that his interest in the turf continued to be very
great; and that his disappointment at the failure of the
West Indian attempt had been excessive, having been confident
of success, and of turning out the Government upon
it. This man gave me many details of his labours and
exertions, all corresponding with what I had heard before.
He often sat up all night, never got any air or exercise, and
passed his whole time between his own house and the House
of Commons, writing, reading, and seeing people, often as
many as twenty or thirty in a day.</p>

<p>Just after writing the above I saw the correspondence
which took place between George Bentinck and Bankes on
his giving up the leadership, from which it was evident that
the labour and anxiety had already begun to make no inconsiderable
inroad on his constitution, and that he was quite
conscious of the risk he incurred by continuing his parliamentary
and political career with the same intensity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RAISING MONEY FOR IRELAND.</div>

<p>The Irish scheme propounded by Charles Buller, and so
readily taken up by the Government (at first), seems now
likely to vanish into smoke. It was soon evident that the
payment of the priests would not be attempted. Clarendon
has been always against it, and he showed me two days ago a
letter from Redington (who had undertaken during his absence
to sound the Catholic prelates), with an account of his conversation
with Archbishop Murray, from which it was clear
that it would be useless to attempt it, and so Redington
himself said, he being the man (so Clarendon told me) above
all others most strongly feeling the degradation of his
Church; so that this matter will be left <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="in the former or same state">in statu quo</i>. Last
night I met Charles Wood, and soon found from his conversation
that there is not much greater probability of the
financial part of the scheme being carried out. He, at all
events, is dead against it, against raising money and expending
capital <i>by the Government</i>. I said something about this
part of the plan, when he said, very contemptuously, 'What,
you are in favour of that scheme, are you? I am surprised
that with your sense you should think it practicable.' He
then went off upon the inexpediency of any government interference.
He admitted the evils that existed, the ruin that
would overtake a great many people, but nevertheless was
for letting matters take their course. He said: 'You are
in too great a hurry. I admit that capital is required for
improvement, but it must come in the regular way and by
private investment. There is great depreciation, and there
will be more, and in the end this will attract capital, and
people who have money to lay out will have recourse to
this as a profitable investment.' It is needless to detail
our several arguments, and sufficient to say that with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer of this mind it is not likely
that anything will be done. I told Charles Buller in the
evening what had passed, and he said it was only what he
expected, as from the moment a <i>Committee</i> of Cabinet was
appointed he was sure nothing would be done.</p>

<p>Charles Wood lamented to me very bitterly the fatal
effects of the mistake Peel had made in abolishing all Corn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
duty whatever (prospectively) and the Timber duties. He
said George Bentinck was quite right in his preference for
low duties instead of abolition, and that if we could now
have the above duties they would relieve the revenue from
almost all its difficulties, and be felt by nobody; and the
unhappy thing is that this mistake is irretrievable, for
<i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="back-tracking">revocare gradum</i> is totally impossible. Peel acknowledged
his error about timber, and probably he might also about
corn. He was, in fact, misled and carried away by his
flourishing revenue, and acted without consideration.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 15th.</i>&mdash;The scheme for improving Ireland seems
likely to fall to the ground altogether. Everybody affirms
or admits that the time is so unpropitious for 'endowment'
that it is useless to think of it, and Charles Wood and George
Grey have convinced themselves that Parliament and the
country will not be disposed to advance money in any shape
for Irish purposes. I had a long conversation with Clarendon
on the subject yesterday, and laboured to persuade him that
this was an error, and that if Government can show that the
money will be judiciously employed, and in all probability
that there will be no ultimate loss to the State, there will
be no difficulty in gaining the assent of Parliament to the
fiscal part of the proposed plan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH ROYAL FAMILY.</div>

<p>In the morning I met Bunsen, who said the King of
Prussia was going on well, and he augured success to his
present measures. It is a great thing to see reaction anywhere,
and the revolutionary and democratic tide rolled back
which has been deluging all Europe; but this is a very
doubtful contest, and the King inspires no confidence. The
Prussian affair points a great moral, and reads an important
lesson. It shows at once the danger of resistance to just
demands and reasonable desires, and the dangers and evils
of full democratic sway, sweeping everything before it. If
the King of Prussia had long ago fulfilled his promises, and
given a constitution to his country while he could have
done so gracefully and safely, the new institutions would
have had time to develope and consolidate themselves, and
would in all probability have proved the security of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Crown when the flood of revolution broke over Europe. He
refused, and fought it off so long that at last his people grew
discontented and angry, and when the French Revolution set
all Germany on fire, the work was so far from being perfected
that the Crown was left to battle with the democratic fury
that broke forth, and its own weakness and vacillation rendered
the power irresistible which might have been coerced
and restrained. Whether it is still time to retrace his steps
remains to be seen. The success of Louis Napoleon in
France now seems beyond all doubt. Thiers has sent a
message to Guizot, through a friend of both, to say that
he is resolved to take no part in his Government, and
Normanby informs me that Odilon Barrot is to be his
Minister. This will make the whole thing perfect, Odilon
Barrot being of all men the most unpractical, and having
failed ridiculously in everything he ever undertook.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 25th.</i>&mdash;I met Guizot at dinner twice last week.
He told me Thiers had sent a man over to him, <i>and to the
King</i>, to make to him the assurance above stated. Rather
curious his keeping up this communication with the exiled
Sovereign and Minister&mdash;the two men, too, whom he most
detests. I asked him if he believed what he said, when he
intimated that it might or might not be true. They have
never sent the Royal Family any money up to this time,
though the Chamber long ago voted back their property; but
the Government have promised to send the King 20,000<i>l.</i>,
and the Duc d'Aumale 10,000<i>l.</i>; the latter has 50,000<i>l.</i> a
year and no debts. From what Guizot's daughter said to
me, it is clear they by no means give up the idea of returning
to France and of his taking a part in public affairs, but
not yet.</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon went to see the King a few days ago, and
was with him two hours, when he told him the whole history
of his flight and all his adventures. He said, he should not
know which to vote for, Cavaignac or Louis Napoleon, if he
had a vote to give. Guizot, however, is all for the latter, I
can very well see. He told me it would be the first step
towards a monarchy, but he did not say what monarchy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
he meant. The King told Clarendon we need not fear a
war; that the army knew its strength, and meant to exercise
it, and would insist on deciding on the political futurity of
France; that it detested the Republic, but had no desire to
go to war, and moreover it could not, for it was <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="bankrupt">dénuée de
tout</i>. He said nobody knew how ill provided the French
army was, and that this was alone a security against war.
Clarendon told him he did not consider it as such, as a
country like France could always provide everything very
quickly, but that he thought there were other causes operating
in the direction of peace. He found him very well and
in very good spirits; he has been greatly pleased at the
visits of the National Guards to him (who went in great
numbers); but it drives him wild when they say to him,
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Sire, why did you leave us">Sire, pourquoi nous avez-vous quittés</span>?' He knows he
threw everything away, and constantly tries to persuade himself
and others that the army would not have supported
him. Flahault said to him the other day that he had no
right to cast such an imputation on the army, which had
proved its fidelity in all circumstances and to all Governments,
even in July, and that the army would have saved
him if it had been allowed to act. Everybody now knows
that if he had done anything but run away, if he had gone
to St. Cloud only, or anywhere, and called the troops about
him, all would have been saved. He threw his cards on the
table, and the game was stupidly and disgracefully lost.</p>

<p>I met Guizot at a dinner at Reeve's on Thursday, with M.
Lemoinne, one of the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="writers">rédacteurs</i> of the 'Journal des Débats,'
and the man who wrote the excellent articles on England and
our politics and condition, showing great knowledge of this
country. There were besides, Woodham, who writes in the
'Times,' a clever man; Longman, Lord Clarendon, and Mr.
Wheaton, the author of a well-known work on the 'Law of
Nations.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD MELBOURNE.</div>

<p>This morning has occurred the death, after a short illness,
of another remarkable man, Charles Buller. He had an operation
successfully performed about ten days ago, but he was
afterwards attacked by typhus fever and diarrhoea. The case
became hopeless, and be expired at half-past five this morning
in the forty-first year of his age. The career of Melbourne
was over; that of Charles Buller for great and useful purposes
may be said to have been only just beginning. His
friends are deeply annoyed and angry at a biographical
article on Melbourne which appeared in the 'Times' the
morning after his death; and it certainly was coarse, vulgar,
and to a great degree unjust. It was a mere daub and
caricature, and very discreditable to the paper.</p>

<p>But it is a difficult thing to write a good article upon
Melbourne, one which shall delineate his character with impartiality
and discrimination, and describe fairly and truly
his political career. I have known a great deal of him in
the course of my life, but I never lived in real intimacy with
him; and as he at no time seemed to have much inclination
for my company, though we were always very good friends,
I saw but little of him; but every now and then we had
something to say to each other, and at rare intervals we met
on intimate and confidential terms. He was certainly a very
singular man, resembling in character and manner, as he
did remarkably in feature, his father, the late Lord Egremont.<a href="#Footnote_77" id="FNanchor_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
He was exceedingly handsome, when first I knew
him, which was in 1815 or thereabouts. It was at this
period that the irregularities of his wife had partly estranged
him from her, though they were not yet separated, and
he was occasionally amused by her into condonation of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
amours, and into a sort of half-laughing, half-resentful
reconciliation. They lived in this queer way. He, good-natured,
eccentric, and not nice; she, profligate, romantic,
and comical. Both were kept together, as they had been
brought together, by the influence and management of their
common relations and connexions; but it was during this
period that he devoted himself with ardour to study, and
that he acquired the vast fund of miscellaneous knowledge
with which his conversation was always replete, and which,
mixed up with his characteristic peculiarities, gave an extraordinary
zest and pungency to his society. His taste for
reading and information, which was confirmed into a habit
by the circumstances of these years, continued to the end of
his life, unbroken, though unavoidably interrupted by his
political avocations. He lived surrounded by books, and
nothing prevented him, even when Prime Minister, and with
all the calls on his time to which he was compelled to attend,
from reading every new publication of interest or merit, as
well as frequently revelling amongst the favourite authors
of his early studies. His memory was extremely retentive,
and amply stored with choice passages of every imaginable
variety, so that he could converse learnedly upon almost all
subjects, and was never at a loss for copious illustrations,
amusing anecdotes, and happy quotations. This richness of
talk was rendered more piquant by the quaintness and oddity
of his manner, and an ease and naturalness proceeding in
no small degree from habits of self-indulgence and freedom,
a license for which was conceded to him by common consent,
even by the Queen herself, who, partly from regard for him,
and partly from being amused at his ways, permitted him to
say and do whatever he pleased in her presence. He was
often paradoxical, and often coarse, terse, epigrammatic,
acute, droll, with fits of silence and abstraction, from which
he would suddenly break out with a vehemence and vigour
which amused those who were accustomed to him, and filled
with indescribable astonishment those who were not. His
mother-in-law, Lady Bessborough, told me that high office
was tendered to him many years before he began to play any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
political part, but at that time he preferred a life of lettered
and social idleness, and he would not accept it. He never
was really well fitted for political life, for he had a great
deal too much candour, and was too fastidious to be a good
party man. It may be said of him, at least in his earlier
days, that he was</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For a patriot too cool, for a drudge disobedient,</span>
<span class="i0">And too fond of the right to pursue the expedient.'</span>
</span></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF LORD MELBOURNE.</div>

<p>And still less was he fit to be the leader of a party and the
head of a Government, for he had neither the strong convictions,
nor the eager ambition, nor the firmness and resolution
which such a post requires. From education and turn
of mind, and from the society in which he was bred and
always lived, he was a Whig; but he was a very moderate
one, abhorring all extremes, a thorough Conservative at
heart, and consequently he was only half identified in
opinion and sympathy with the party to which he belonged
when in office; he often dreaded and distrusted his colleagues,
and was secretly the enemy of the measures which
his own Government originated, and of which he was
obliged to take the credit or bear the obloquy. No position
could be more false than the position in which Melbourne
was often placed, and no man ever was more perplexed
and tormented than he was by it, for he was remarkably
sensitive; and most of the latter years of his administration
were passed in a state of dissatisfaction with himself and
with all about him. He hated the Reform Bill, which he
was obliged to advocate. He saw, indeed, that Reform had
become irresistible, and therefore he reconciled it to his
conscience to support the Bill; but he had not sufficient
energy of character or strength of will to make a stand
against the lengths which he disapproved, and he contented
himself with those indirect attempts to modify it which
I have narrated in their proper place. It was probably
his personal popularity, and the reluctance of Lord Lansdowne
to take so laborious a post,<a href="#Footnote_78" id="FNanchor_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> which led to his being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
made Prime Minister on the resignation of Lord Grey, for
there never was a man more incapable of exercising the
vigilance and supremacy which that office demands. After
the great breach of 1835, and the abortive attempt of
William IV. to throw over the Whig Government, his
relations with his Ministers became very uncomfortable;
but Melbourne was a good-natured man, and a gentleman,
and perhaps no one else would have gone on with the King
so harmoniously as he managed it.</p>

<p>But it was upon the accession of the Queen that his post
suddenly grew into one of immense importance and interest,
for he found himself placed in the most curious and delicate
position which any statesman ever occupied. Victoria was
transferred at once from the nursery to the throne&mdash;ignorant,
inexperienced, and without one human being about her on
whom she could rely for counsel and aid. She found in her
Prime Minister and constitutional adviser a man of mature
age, who instantly captivated her feelings and her fancy by
his deferential solicitude, and by a shrewd, sagacious, and
entertaining conversation, which were equally new and delightful
to her. She at once cast herself with implicit confidence
upon Melbourne, and, from the first day of her reign,
their relations assumed a peculiar character, and were marked
by an intimacy which he never abused; on the contrary, he
only availed himself of his great influence to impress upon
her mind sound maxims of constitutional government, and
truths of every description that it behoved her to learn.
It is impossible to imagine anything more interesting than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
more calculated to excite all the latent sensibility of his
nature. His loyal devotion soon warmed into a parental
affection, which she repaid by unbounded manifestations of
confidence and regard. He set himself wisely, and with
perfect disinterestedness, to form her mind and character,
and to cure the defects and eradicate the prejudices from
which the mistakes and faults of her education had not left
her entirely free. In all that Melbourne said or did, he
appears to have been guided by a regard to justice and
truth. He never scrupled to tell her what none other would
have dared to say; and in the midst of that atmosphere of
flattery and deceit which kings and queens are almost always
destined to breathe, and by which their minds are so often
perverted, he never scrupled to declare boldly and frankly
his real opinions, strange as they sometimes sounded, and
unpalatable as they often were, and to wage war with her
prejudices and false impressions with regard to people or
things whenever he saw that she was led astray by them.
He acted in all things an affectionate, conscientious, and
patriotic part, endeavouring to make her happy as a woman,
and popular as a queen.</p>

<p>It is notorious that he committed two great errors in
judgement, both of which were attended with disastrous consequences,
and I believe that in both cases his discretion
was misled by his feelings, and that it was his care for her
ease and happiness which betrayed him into these fatal mistakes.
The first was the Flora Hastings affair, the scandal
of which he might certainly have prevented; the other was
the Bedchamber quarrel, when her reluctance to part with
him, and his tenderness for her, overruled his better judgement,
and made him adopt a course he must have known
to be both impossible and wrong. In these affairs (especially
the first), Melbourne must have suffered torments,
for his tender solicitude for the Queen, and the deep
sense of his own responsibility, were sure to weigh heavily
upon him. His influence and authority at Court were not
diminished, nor his position there altered by her marriage;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
but the Prince, though always living on very friendly terms
with him, was secretly rejoiced when the political power of
this great favourite was brought to a close; for, so long as
Melbourne was there, he undoubtedly played but an obscure
and secondary part. When the inevitable change of Government
at last took place, the parting between the Queen and
her Minister was very sorrowful to both of them, and it was
then that he gave his last and generous proof of his anxiety
for her happiness in sending me with his advice to Peel.</p>

<p>It would be rendering imperfect justice to Melbourne's
character to look upon him rather as a courtier than as
a statesman, and to fancy that he made his political principles
subordinate to his personal predilections. He was
deeply attached to the Queen, but he had all the patriotism
of an English gentleman, and was jealous of the honour and
proud of the greatness of his country. He held office with
a profound sense of its responsibilities; there never was a
Minister more conscientious in the distribution of patronage,
more especially of his ecclesiastical patronage. He
was perfectly disinterested, without nepotism, and without
vanity; he sought no emoluments for his connexions, and
steadily declined all honours for himself. The Queen often
pressed him to accept the Garter, but he never would consent,
and it was remarked that the Prime Minister of England
was conspicuous at Court for being alone undecorated amidst
the stars and ribands which glittered around him. He has
been not inappropriately compared to Sallustius Crispus, as
described by Tacitus: '<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Although willing to assume the positions of access, without the dignity of many senators triumphal consulariumque potentially humans, different from the old institution, and the service and cleanliness abundance of luxury and excess nearer.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MELBOURNE'S CONVERSATIONS AND OPINIONS.</div>

<p>At the time Melbourne left office he was only an occasional
guest at Court, but the Queen continued to correspond
with him constantly, and gave him frequent proofs that her
regard for him was undiminished. He took very little part
in politics after 1841, and it was not long before his health
began to give way. He had been so completely absorbed by
the Court, that for many years he had been almost lost to
society; but as soon as he was out of office, he resumed his
old habits, and was continually to be found at Holland
House, at Lady Palmerston's, and with a few other intimate
friends. There he loved to lounge and sprawl at his ease,
pouring out a rough but original stream of talk, shrewd,
playful, and instructive. His distinctive qualities were
strong sound sense, and an innate taste for what was great
and good, either in action or sentiment. His mind kindled,
his eye brightened, and his tongue grew eloquent when
noble examples or sublime conceptions presented themselves
before him. He would not have passed 'unmoved by any
scene that was consecrated by virtue, by valour, or by
wisdom.' But while he pursued truth, as a philosopher,
his love of paradox made him often appear a strange mass
of contradiction and inconsistency. A sensualist and a
Sybarite, without much refinement or delicacy, a keen
observer of the follies and vices of mankind, taking the
world as he found it, and content to extract as much
pleasure and diversion as he could from it, he at one time
would edify and astonish his hearers with the most exalted
sentiments, and at another would terrify and shock them by
indications of the lowest morality and worldly feelings, and
by thoughts and opinions fraught with the most cold-hearted
mocking and sarcasm. His mind seems all his life long, and
on almost every subject, to have been vigorous and stirring,
but unsettled and unsatisfied. It certainly was so on the
two great questions of religion and politics, and he had no
profound convictions, no certain assurance about either. He
studied divinity eagerly and constantly, and was no contemptible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
theologian; but he never succeeded in arriving
at any fixed belief, or in anchoring himself on any system
of religious faith. It was the same thing in politics. All
the Liberal and Constitutional theories which he had ever
entertained had been long ago more than realised, and he
was filled with alarm at the prospect of their further extension.
All his notions were aristocratic, and he had not
a particle of sympathy for what was called progressive
reform. He was a vehement supporter of the Corn Laws,
abused Peel with all the rancour of a Protectionist, and died
in the conviction that his measures will prove the ruin of the
landed interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF CHARLES BULLER.</div>

<p>During his administration his great object seemed to
be to keep a rickety concern together, less from political
ambition than from his personal feelings for the Queen.
He abhorred disputes and quarrels of every description,
and he was constantly temporising and patching them up
when they occurred in his Cabinet (as they often did) by
all sorts of expedients, seldom asserting either the dignity
or the authority of his position as head of the Government.
Such weak and unworthy misrule brought his Cabinet, his
party, and himself into contempt, and it was unquestionably
in great measure owing to his want of judgement and firmness
that they became so unpopular, and at last fell with so
little credit and dignity as they did in 1841. He was
capricious about money, and generous and stingy by fits
and starts. Easy and indolent, he suffered himself to be
plundered by his servants, and took little trouble in looking
after his affairs. He was fond of his family, and much beloved
by them, but, both with regard to them and his friends,
he was full of a jealousy and touchiness, which made him
keenly alive to any appearance of indifference, and equally
sensible of any attentions that were shown him. This grew
into a morbid feeling after his health had given way, and
tinged his latter days with melancholy, for he fancied himself
neglected and uncared for. On the promotion of Lord John
Russell's Government, he was mortified at not being invited
to take a share in it. It was evident that he was conscious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
of, and bitterly felt, the decay of his own powers, and the
insignificance to which he was reduced. He would, if he
could, have disguised this from himself and others, but it
preyed on his mind, and made him very unhappy, and often
apparently morose. Sometimes his feelings would find vent
in these lines from the 'Samson Agonistes,' which he would
repeat with a sad memory of the past, and sense of the
present:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So much I feel my general spirit droop,</span>
<span class="i0">My hopes all flat, nature within me seems</span>
<span class="i0">In all her functions weary of herself,</span>
<span class="i0">My race of glory run, and race of shame,</span>
<span class="i0">And I shall shortly be with them that rest.</span>
</span></p>
</div>

<p>Taking him altogether, he was a very remarkable man in
his abilities and his acquirements, in his character and in
his career, with virtues and vices, faults and merits, curiously
intermingled, and producing as eccentric results as society
has often beheld.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 2nd.</i>&mdash;The death of Charles Buller has occurred
when he can be ill spared to the party of which he was
rapidly becoming an important member, and to the country
which he was capable of serving. He is a great social and
a great public loss, more especially in days of mediocrity
and barrenness like the present. He was clever, amiable,
accomplished, and honest. His abilities were of a very high
order, and though he loved the world and its pursuits, he
had great powers of application. Few people were more
agreeable and entertaining in society, and he had a very
gentle and affectionate disposition. He never made, and
never would have made, much progress in the profession of
the law, which he originally embraced. It was evidently
unsuited to his genius, his taste, and his habits, and he
judged rightly in exchanging it once for all for a political
career in which, had his life been spared, he would have
achieved great eminence. In politics he was originally a
Radical, but though the old leaven not unfrequently showed
itself, it was greatly modified in his latter years; and when
he manifested ultra-Liberal sympathies, it was probably more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
from love of paradox and controversy, than from real and
sincere conviction. His political opinions, however, which
for a long time seem to have been in an unsettled and transitional
state, he never suppressed or compromised for any
personal interest; and though he was both very ambitious
and very poor, he never committed a mean or discreditable
act for the sake of either favour or office. A man more
honourable and independent never existed, and he would
have been indebted for the political exaltation which was
certainly in store for him to nothing but the force and
influence of his own capacity and power. His career of
usefulness was in fact only beginning. Up to a very recent
period he had made no progress in public life commensurate
with his ability, and especially with his parliamentary talents;
but if justice was not done him, it was mainly because he
did not do justice to himself. He was perhaps the most
popular member of the House of Commons. By universal
acknowledgement he was an admirable speaker, full of
matter, lucid, never dull, and generally very amusing, so
that he never rose without being sure of an attentive and
favourable audience. His greatest speeches were on dry and
serious subjects, such as colonisation, emigration, or records,
none of which became heavy or uninteresting in his hands.
He had, however, one great defect, which not only rendered
him less agreeable in society than he would otherwise have
been, but which had a very serious and unhappy influence
on his political career. He was seduced by his keen perception
of the ridiculous and an irresistible propensity to banter
into an everlasting mockery of everything and everybody,
which not only often became tiresome and provoking, but
gave an appearance of levity to his character that largely
deducted from the estimation in which he would otherwise
have been held. It was impossible to be sure when he was
in earnest and when he was in jest, when he really meant
what he said, and when he was only jeering, gibing, and
making game. It is incredible what damage this pernicious
habit did him; for it created a notion that though he was
very witty and entertaining, he had no settled principles and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
convictions, and that he 'made a mockery of life.' Of this
defect (with which his friends had often reproached him) he
was manifestly curing himself. He had begun to take a
more sober and earnest view of the great concerns of the
world, and his really excellent understanding was asserting
its predominance over the wild vagaries of his wit. In thus
disciplining his mind into more of practical wisdom, he was
paving the way for his own success; and had he not been
snatched away thus suddenly, 'while his hopes were as warm
and his desires as eager as ours,' he would have become an
eminent man. As it is he has left behind him a memory
cherished for its delightful social qualities, and a vast credit
for undeveloped powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLAN FOR IRISH EMIGRATION.</div>

<p>Yesterday, Clarendon went to the Grange on his way to
Dublin. I had a long conversation with him before he went.
He told me what they are meditating for Ireland. They
give up all idea of paying the priests, and laying out money
for any purpose but that of emigration. For this, however,
they have a great scheme connected with Canadian railways.
Their purpose is to establish a vast line of railways
in Canada, and to make a large emigration from Ireland
for this purpose. A tax on Canadian timber, and a sum of
money to be borrowed here, the interest on which Clarendon
thinks he can supply (180,000<i>l.</i>), are to provide the necessary
funds. They have satisfied themselves that this is as
much as they can venture to attempt.</p>

<p>He informed me that Wylde (to whom the Prince is in
the habit of talking very openly) told him that the Prince had
been discussing with him the possibility of some change of
government being rendered necessary by Lord John's health
breaking down, and that they would like him (Clarendon)
to succeed him, and that if such an event occurred, the
Queen would certainly send for him to consult him on the
subject. Clarendon desired him to take an opportunity of
telling the Prince that no power on earth should induce
him to accept such a post, and as it was much better the
Queen should never make an overture which would not be
accepted, he wished none such might ever be made to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
He then gave his reasons for considering himself disqualified.
I told him they would not accept his excuses, because
since his Irish administration he had acquired a reputation
which rendered him in the eyes of the world fit for any post,
but that I understood well why for various reasons he might
wish to decline the office. He said he could not speak, and
had not had parliamentary experience enough, having come
too late into the House of Lords, and never having been
in the House of Commons. Finally he begged me to tell
anybody who suggested such a possible contingency, that
no power on earth would ever induce him to take it. But
I don't think he was displeased when I told him I should
certainly not say that, because I did not consider it so
absolutely impossible, and that events might occur, and
the state of parties be such, that his acceptance of the post
would become a matter of public duty on his part. The
truth is, he is sincere in his disclaimer, but with an <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="after thought">arrière
pensée</i> of ambition, which not unnaturally smiles on the idea
of such a prodigious elevation.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 9th.</i>&mdash;I dined on Tuesday last with Milman,
Guizot, Macaulay, and Hallam; Macaulay receiving felicitations
with great modesty and compliments on his book,<a href="#Footnote_80" id="FNanchor_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
of which the whole impression was sold off, and not a copy
was to be got, though it had only been out three days.
Macaulay and Hallam talked of a branch of our literature
of which Guizot, well informed as he is, could know nothing.
Macaulay's French is detestable, the most barbarous accent
that ever has <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="skinned ears">écorché les oreilles</i> of a Parisian.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I breakfasted with Macaulay, very small
party and nothing remarkable. Went in the afternoon to see
Lord Beauvale.<a href="#Footnote_81" id="FNanchor_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
He talked to me of Melbourne, and so did
she. They are not at all pleased at Brougham's being his
executor, which astonishes everybody. It would be mighty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
inconvenient to have Melbourne's papers overhauled by
Brougham. Ellice has written to him to propose that they
should all be delivered to Beauvale unseen by anybody. He
left a letter for Beauvale. In this letter he gives certain
pecuniary directions in favour of Lady Brandon and Mrs.
Norton, and a solemn declaration that what he had instructed
the Attorney-General to say on the trial as to her
purity was true. He said that, as his indiscretion had exposed
her to obloquy and suspicion, he was bound to renew
this declaration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELECTION OF LOUIS NAPOLEON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Bowood, December 20th.</i>&mdash;The result of the French election
for President has astonished the whole world.<a href="#Footnote_82" id="FNanchor_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Everybody
thought Louis Napoleon would be elected, but nobody
dreamt of such a majority. Great alarm was felt here at
the probable consequences of Cavaignac's defeat and the
success of his rival, and the French funds were to rise if
Napoleon was beaten, and to fall if he won. The election
has taken place: Napoleon wins by an immense majority,
the funds rise, confidence recovers, and people begin to find
out that the new President is a marvellous proper man. I
really believe that the foolish affair of the tame eagle in 1840
was the principal cause of the contempt with which he was
regarded here; added to this, he led an undistinguished life
in this country, associating with no conspicuous people, and
his miserable failure in the Chamber when he attempted to
speak there, confirmed the unfavourable impression. But
Van de Weyer, who is here, says that he has long known
him and well, that he is greatly underrated here, and is
really a man of considerable ability. He crossed the water
with him when he went to take his seat after his election
to the Assembly, and he then expressed the most undoubting
confidence in his own success at the Presidential election,
and said that he had every reason to believe, if he chose to
put himself forward, he would be supported by an immense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
force, and that he might assume any position he pleased;
but that he should do nothing of the kind, that he had a
legal position beyond which he would not force himself, but
that he was prepared to accept all the consequences to which
it might lead. And now there is a pretty general opinion
that he will be Emperor before long. The ex-Ministers and
Legitimists, who were hot for his election, considering him
merely as a bridge over which the Bourbons might return to
power, begin to think the success greater than is agreeable,
and that such a unanimous expression of public opinion
may lead to the restoration of the Bonapartes instead of to
that of the Bourbons.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, January 2nd, 1849.</i>&mdash;The past year, which has
been so fertile in public misfortunes and private sorrows,
wound up its dismal catalogue with a great and unexpected
calamity, the death of Auckland, who went to the Grange
in perfect health on Friday last, was struck down by a fit
of apoplexy on his return from shooting on Saturday, and
died early on Monday morning, having only shown a slight
and momentary consciousness on seeing his sister Fanny in
the course of Sunday. His loss to the Government is irreparable,
and to his family it is unspeakably great. To his
sisters he was as a husband, a brother, and a friend combined
in one, and to them it is a bereavement full of sadness almost
amounting to despair. He was a man without shining qualities
or showy accomplishments, austere and almost forbidding
in his manner, silent and reserved in society, unpretending
both in public and in private life, and in the House of Lords
taking a rare and modest part in debate, and seldom speaking
but on the business of his own department. Nevertheless
he was universally popular, and his company more desired
and welcome than that of many far more sprightly and
brilliant men. His understanding was excellent, his temper
placid, his taste and tact exquisite; his disposition, notwithstanding
his apparent gravity, cheerful, and under his cold
exterior there was a heart overflowing with human kindness,
and with the deepest feelings of affection, charity, and benevolence.
Engaged from almost his earliest youth in politics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
and the chances and changes of public life, he had no personal
enemies and many attached friends amongst men of
all parties. His colleagues in office were fully sensible of
the merits which he never endeavoured to push forward,
and he was successively raised to the posts of President
of the Board of Trade, First Lord of the Admiralty, and
Governor-General of India; and he was a second time
First Lord of the Admiralty on the formation of John
Russell's Administration in 1846.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD AUCKLAND.</div>

<p>His government of India was the subject of general applause
till just as it was about to close, when the unfortunate Cabul
disaster tarnished its fame, and exposed him to reproaches
which he did not deserve. Whether that expedition was
wisely or unwisely undertaken, it is incontestable that it was
suggested or sanctioned by some of the greatest authorities
both in England and in India; that the military operations
were completely successful, and that the subsequent misfortunes
were not attributable to any neglect or impolicy
on the part of the civil government. But rage and shame
took possession of the public mind at the bloody and discreditable
reverse which befel our arms, and without any
discrimination all who were concerned in the invasion were
involved in a common sentence of indignant reprobation.
Lord Auckland bore this bitter disappointment with the
calmness and dignity of a man who felt that he had no
cause for self-reproach, probably trusting to an ultimate
and unprejudiced estimate of the general merits of his
laborious and conscientious administration.</p>

<p>His conduct of affairs at the Admiralty, his diligence, his
urbanity, his fairness and impartiality have been the theme of
loud and general praise. In an office in which jobbing and
partiality have so often prevailed, in which from the nature
of the service the Minister is compelled to disappoint many
fair hopes and just expectations, and to wound the pride, the
vanity, and the feelings of many brave and honourable men,
it requires the greatest firmness to be just, and the nicest
tact and delicacy to avoid giving offence. In this most difficult
function no First Lord ever was more successful than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Auckland. Always patient and affable, holding out none of
the false hopes which in the end make sick hearts, dealing
openly and frankly with his officers, he inspired the whole
profession with confidence and esteem. Such a character
and such a career may well be envied by every well-regulated
mind; nor can the termination of that career, however
grievous and deplorable to all who loved him, be regarded
as an unhappy destiny for himself, for if the pursuits and
pleasures of existence were suddenly and prematurely cut
off, he was spared from sickness and infirmity with their
train of suffering and sorrow, and from the privations which
attend the approaches of old age and the gradual decay of
the bodily and mental powers. He closed a useful, honourable,
and prosperous life with his faculties unimpaired,
leaving behind him a memory universally honoured and
regretted, and cherished by the tender affection and inconsolable
grief of his family and his friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETROSPECT OF THE YEAR.</div>

<p>This <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Wonderful Year">Annus Mirabilis</i>, as it may well be called, is at last
over, and one cannot but feel glad at getting rid of a year
which has been so pregnant with every sort of mischief.
Revolutions, ruin, sickness, and death have ravaged the
world publicly and privately; every species of folly and
wickedness seems to have been let loose to riot on the earth.
It would be easy to write a great deal of wise matter, but
very little that is new, on these topics. If ever mankind is
destined to learn by its own experience, to look at beginnings,
middles, and endings, to see what comes of what, and
to test the virtue, wisdom, and utility of plausible maxims
and high-sounding phrases, this has been the time for mankind's
going to school and studying the lessons put before
it. We have seen such a stirring up of all the elements of
society as nobody ever dreamt of; we have seen a general
Saturnalia&mdash;ignorance, vanity, insolence, poverty, ambition,
escaping from every kind of restraint, ranging over the
world and turning it topsy-turvy as it pleased. Every theory
and crotchet has had full swing, and powers and dominations
have bowed their necks to the yoke and cowered under
the misbegotten tyranny which has suddenly changed places
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
with them. Democracy and philanthropy have never before
(or hardly ever) had their own way without let or hindrance,
<i>carte blanche</i> to work out their own great and fancy designs.
This time they leave behind them&mdash;and all Europe exhibits
the result&mdash;a mass of ruin, terror, and despair. Nothing
strikes one more than the poverty of invention as well as the
egregious folly of the new patriots all over the world. They
can think of nothing but overturning everything that exists,
and of reconstructing the social and political machine by
universal suffrage. To execute the most difficult task which
the human mind can have set before it, the task which demands
the highest qualities of knowledge, experience, and
capacity, it is thought enough to invite masses of men with
strong passions and prejudices, without even any of that
practical knowledge which might serve, though inadequately,
to enable them to play their part in this prodigious operation.
Universal suffrage is to pick out the men fit to frame
new Constitutions, and when the delegates thus chosen have
been brought together&mdash;no matter how ignorant, how stupid,
how in every way unfit they may be&mdash;they expect to be
allowed to have their own absurd and ruinous way, and to
break up at their caprice and pleasure all the ancient foundations,
and tear down the landmarks of society; and this
havoc, and ruin, and madness, are dignified with the fine
names of constitutional reform. Nor can the excuse be
urged that this inundation of wickedness and folly has been
brought about by a resistance which stood out too long, and
was at last swept away by the effects of its own obstinacy.</p>

<p>Leaving out France altogether, whose Revolution was an
accident&mdash;and France is retracing her steps as fast as she
can, scrambling, crestfallen, perplexed, and half-ruined, out
of the abyss into which she suffered herself to be plunged&mdash;let
us look at Prussia and Rome. In both places the sovereigns
spontaneously advanced to meet the wishes and promote
the interests of the people: they went to work in the
right way. In countries where the people had never exercised
political rights and privileges, where self-government
was unknown, it was clear that the masses were not capable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
of legislating or taking an immediate part in framing Constitutions
for themselves; but in every country, even in the
Roman States, there were some men of education, knowledge,
genius, who were more or less qualified to undertake the
great work, and the Pope called such men to his councils,
and gave the Romans the framework of a Government as
liberal as was compatible with the working of any government
at all. This was what sense and reason suggested;
but, though it pleased his foolish and despicable people for a
moment, they soon got tired of such safe and gradual progress
as this, ran riot, flung off all control, and proceeded
from one excess to another, constantly rising in the scale of
democracy, till they reached their climax by assassinating
the Pope's Minister, and forcing the Pope himself to escape
in disguise from Rome. Nobody knows what they want,
nor do they know themselves how they are to recover from
the anarchy and ruin in which they are so deeply plunged.</p>

<p>In Prussia better things might have been expected, for
there at least the people are better educated, and they have
enjoyed municipal institutions, and do know something of
the practice of civil administration; nevertheless, Prussia
has not shown until lately much more moderation and
wisdom than Rome. This, however, now appears to have
been entirely the King's fault. If he had displayed more
firmness and decision he would have rallied round him the
Conservative feelings and interests of the country; but when
these interests found themselves abandoned by a Sovereign
who commanded 200,000 faithful troops, and they saw him
bowing his head to the dictation of the rabble of Berlin,
they lost all heart, and democracy became rampant and
unrestrained.</p>

<p>At length a reaction began. Vienna first, and Berlin
afterwards, were reduced to obedience, and the tide is now
flowing back. It is impossible to speculate on the final
result, but for the present at least the disgust and abhorrence
of the brutal excesses committed under the pretence
of a spurious liberalism are intense and apparently increasing.

<div class="sidenote">THE ADMIRALTY OFFERED TO GRAHAM.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, January 19th.</i>&mdash;Lord Auckland's death naturally
excited great interest and curiosity about the Admiralty.
The first and most general feeling was a desire that Lord
Minto might not be his successor. This was proclaimed
in the press and in all places; but such a disagreeable
manifestation was hard upon him, as it turned out that
he not only never aspired to the place, but he at once told
John Russell to take the Privy Seal from him without
scruple and do anything he pleased with it if his resignation
would be of use in any fresh combination he might wish to
make; in fact, he behaved very well. Lord John resolved
to make the offer to Graham (after having consulted Lord
Lansdowne) provided the Cabinet did not object. He called
them together and proposed him. Though certainly some
of them did not like it, they consented unanimously, and he
accordingly wrote to Graham and asked him to come up to
town. Graham arrived, and they had a long and frank conversation.
Graham said he was quite independent, and his
being invited <i>alone</i> was no objection. He asked Lord John
what the views and intentions of Government were, and
Lord John explained everything to him in the most open
and candid manner. Graham seems to have made no objections
to anybody or anything, but rather to have hinted his
apprehensions that they might not go far enough in the way
of economy; and he showed some leaning towards Cobden's
schemes, that is, he said he thought there was a great deal
in his speech and letter. At the end of the conversation he
asked Lord John if he had any objection to his consulting
Peel, who, he had reason to believe, was to pass through
London that afternoon; if he had, he would give him his
answer at once. Lord John said he had no objection, and
Graham went away. In the evening he came back, said he
had missed Peel and could not consult him, and finally he
declined, somewhat I think to Lord John's surprise, for
he gave no good reason for declining, and, after asking for
information as to the Government plans, and appearing
satisfied with them, Lord John naturally expected he would
accept. They parted on very friendly terms, but Lord John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
is not pleased; it has not raised his opinion of Graham, and
he will not make him another proposal if he can help it.
They cannot understand his conduct and motives, but they
think he was afraid&mdash;which probably is the truth. They
then proposed it to Sir Francis Baring, who took it directly.
On the whole he will probably be of more use to them than
Graham. The accession of the latter would have been distasteful
to the Whigs generally and to many of the Government;
he would not have been at his ease with his colleagues
nor they with him, and I only wonder he ever hesitated. It
is perhaps as well that the offer was made to him, but on
the whole better as it is. The Protectionists, who, contemptible
as they are as a party, can always do some mischief,
would have been more disposed to thwart and embarrass
the Government when Graham had become a part of it, for
he is their favourite aversion.</p>

<p>Cobden's new economical agitation is making a great
stir, and the Government are so uneasy at it that they are
moving heaven and earth in the way of reduction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTACKS ON LORD PALMERSTON.</div>

<p>Palmerston has been dreadfully nettled at some recent
attacks on him in the 'Times.' Charles Wood sent for
Delane and entreated him to desist from these bitter attacks,
and he promised he would for the present; he said they had
recorded their opinions and did not want to do any more.
The state of our foreign affairs and Palmerston's management
of them are the astonishment of Europe. There will
certainly be more discussion than usual about them in the
ensuing Session, but probably with no more result than
heretofore. Stanley and Aberdeen will do their best or
their worst in the House of Lords, but all their blows will
fall on the soft, non-resisting cushion of Lansdowne's evasive
urbanity, while in the House of Commons there will be
nobody to attack Palmerston, and between those who won't
grapple with him, and those who can't, he will come off
unscathed, as he has always done. It is said, however, that
he is more uneasy (as well he may be) than he ever was
before, and from several little symptoms I expect this to be
the case. Whether <i>he</i> is or not his colleagues are, and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
Royal Mistress still more. Within the last few days fresh
difficulties have arisen with reference to Lord Palmerston's
conduct of foreign affairs, for he keeps the Queen, his colleagues,
his friends, and the party in continual hot water;
and on this occasion he seems to have given serious offence
to a foreign Power, insomuch that a formal apology is said
to be required of him. Yet Lord John has made up his
mind to fight through the Session in defence of a colleague
whose proceedings give him perpetual annoyance. Aberdeen
has been with Peel, and says that he is still more animated
against Palmerston than he is himself, and he expects that
Peel will not abstain from manifesting his opinion when
Parliament meets. Aberdeen said he had no hostility to the
Government, and no objection to anything but the conduct
of foreign affairs, so much so that if Clarendon came to the
Foreign Office he would give him his proxy if he would hold
it. The Government are evidently in a stew. There was
an article in the 'Times' on Thursday, in which, though
there was no attack on Palmerston, who was not named,
there was an allusion to former articles and to our conduct
to Austria, which evidently rubbed on a sore place, for
Charles Wood sent for Delane and expressed his regret that
we were on such bad terms with Austria. Delane said, he
had all along been saying the same thing, when Charles
Wood replied that he did not think we had <i>done</i> anything
we could not justify and defend, but unfortunately Palmerston's
manner of doing things and the language he employed
had given great offence, and that it was much to be regretted
that he had given advice and expressed opinions in so offensive
a tone as he had done, especially to Austria.<a href="#Footnote_83" id="FNanchor_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> All this
showed clearly enough that Austria was the Power whom he
last insulted. He has not, however, been quite idle about
Russia, having instructed Stratford Canning to move the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Porte to take some steps to thwart Russian policy in that
quarter. Canning was very prudent, and nothing serious
came of it; but the Emperor is informed of his proceedings,
and has taken care to let him know that he is, without
making any quarrel. He has also given Palmerston to
understand that it is not his intention to allow great
European questions, in which he may naturally be expected
to take an interest, to be dealt with without his being consulted
and considered.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, January 28th.</i>&mdash;It appears that Graham did not
give the same account to Peel and to Lord Aberdeen of what
had passed with John Russell about his taking office. Lord
John says that he appeared well inclined to accept, made
no serious objections to anybody or to anything, and that
he could not make out why he finally refused. It is clear,
however, that Graham must have given some reasons for
declining, and, in fact, they are pretty well agreed as to the
latter part of their several statements. John Russell, when
the Queen asked him why Graham declined, told her that
the reasons he gave were some doubts whether their contemplated
reductions would go far enough, and some objections
as to the foreign policy; but Lord John clearly thought
that these doubts and objections were so faintly expressed
that they did not amount to anything like insuperable
obstacles. He said with reference to foreign policy, that it
always must be remembered that Palmerston had kept us
at peace, and as Graham went away expressly to consult
Peel, that implied that if Peel advised him to accept he would
do so. This is not the conduct of a man who had serious
objections to our past policy. Of course he could not join
without subscribing to the past and undertaking its defence;
but to Peel he declared that he had refused because he could
not approve of or defend Palmerston's foreign policy, and
because their reductions were not sufficient, putting his
objections and refusal in a much stronger way than he
appears to have put them to Lord John. All this comes
from his timidity, and I have no doubt the want of a really
clear conscience. He pines for office, he dreads to take it;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
he knows he is an object of suspicion and dislike to people of
all parties; he is embarrassed with his own position; he is
clear-sighted enough to perceive all its entanglements and
difficulties. All sorts of absurd stories are current about his
demands and what the negotiation went off upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPENING OF THE SESSION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 7th.</i>&mdash;Parliament opened last Thursday, and
the Government began the campaign very victoriously. A
great flourish of trumpets had been sounded to announce
the attack which Lord Stanley was to make, especially on
the vulnerable point of the foreign policy, and the Government
and their friends were not at all easy as to the result.
Stanley's was one of the worst speeches he ever made, ill
put together and arranged, full of ignorance, and consequently
of misrepresentations and misstatements. Lord Lansdowne
made a very able and judicious reply. The Government got
a majority of two in a division which Stanley most unwisely
forced on, and the affair ended in a general opinion that the
Ministers had much the best of it, and that Stanley had been
signally defeated. His blunders, however, were not confined
to his speech. He had at first determined not to move any
amendment to the Address, and the Duke of Wellington
had entreated him not to do so. He had accordingly told
Eglinton, his whipper-in, he should not, and Eglinton told
Strafford none would be moved. Then Stanley changed
his mind, contrary to the opinions of Eglinton and others,
and much to the annoyance of the former, who had misled
Strafford by his information. After Lansdowne's speech, to
persist in the amendment was very injudicious. The Duke
of Wellington opposed it in a very sensible speech, when
Stanley rose and said there was nothing in his amendment
about foreign affairs; on which Lord St. Germains pointed
out to him that that was an express allusion to them. He
said he had forgotten it, and still persisted; but it is much
believed that some of his own people were sent away to
avoid the embarrassment of their being in a majority. So
much for the Lords.</p>

<p>In the Commons Government was equally triumphant.
There had been a great deal of squabbling among the Protectionists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
about their leadership, some wanting Herries,
some Granby, and some Disraeli, and when Parliament met
there was nothing settled. Stanley had written a flummery
letter to Disraeli, full of compliments, but suggesting to
him to let Herries have the lead. Disraeli, brimful of indignation
against Stanley and contempt for Herries, returned
a cold but civil answer, saying he did not want to
be leader, and that he should gladly devote himself more to
literature and less to politics than he had been able to do
for some time past. Meanwhile Herries declined the post,
and Granby with Lord Henry Bentinck insisted on Disraeli's
appointment, both as the fittest man, and as a homage to
George Bentinck's memory. I saw a note from Disraeli a
day or two ago, saying he had received the adhesions of
two-thirds of this party. In the House of Commons he
appeared as leader, for he moved Stanley's Amendment,
which was sent to him so late that he placed Stanley's
draft in his own handwriting in the Speaker's hands. He
made a clever speech with some appearance of attacking
Palmerston in earnest. The debate was adjourned, and the
next night Palmerston made one of the cleverest, most
impudent, and most effective speeches that ever was heard.
It took vastly with the House, threw his opponents into
confusion, and he came out of the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> with flying colours.
The Opposition have committed nothing but blunders, and
the Government have naturally reaped the benefit of them,
and they are in a high state of elation.</p>

<p>As soon as Graham came to town, he called on me, and
gave me his reasons for not having accepted office. He said
nothing could be handsomer or more gratifying than John
Russell's conduct to him. He had been more than frank,
he had been confidential, and had told him things that he
desired him not to repeat even to Peel or Aberdeen, and
which he said he never would repeat to anybody. Graham
made an excellent case for himself, and after hearing him I
am satisfied that he both acted fairly and judged wisely.
He said, 'I have played some pranks before high heaven
in my time. I quitted the Whigs once, and it would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
do to quit them again; and unless I could subscribe to all
their past conduct and policy, as well as feel quite satisfied
for the future, it was better not to join.' The great
obstacle he owned was Palmerston, and he anticipated being
very likely placed in a state of collision with him, which
might have been most embarrassing to himself and to the
Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR J. GRAHAM DECLINES OFFICE.</div>

<p>On Sunday he came to me again. He told me he had
called on Stanley and had a good deal of conversation with
him. Stanley found fault with Clarendon's letter, which
he thought insufficient for the re-suspension of the Habeas
Corpus,<a href="#Footnote_84" id="FNanchor_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
and Graham said it appeared to him very meagre.
He then went on to say that he felt great difficulty in supporting
such a coercive measure, when unaccompanied by
any remedial measures whatever; that he did not wish to do
or say anything to embarrass the Government, but he could
not conceal his opinion that remedial measures ought to be
brought forward, especially the payment of the Irish Clergy,
and he felt the more difficulty about this, because Disraeli in
his speech had made an evident appeal to Protestant bigotry
by treating this question as altogether gone by and defunct,
and one which never could be raised again, and against this
he thought a protest ought to be made. He said he was
much struck by the absence of all allusion to the suspension
of the Habeas Corpus in both Stanley's and Disraeli's speeches,
and he could not help thinking they were preparing to
embarrass the Government by some opposition to it, and
consequently that the task of carrying it through the House
of Commons would not be so easy as Government imagined.
He gave me to understand that he wished me to communicate
to John Russell what he had said to me.</p>

<p>The next day I went and told Lord John what had
passed, and afterwards I told Lord Lansdowne. Yesterday
morning I saw Graham again, when I found him no longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
inclined to think that Stanley would take any part against
the Habeas Corpus Bill. When I got to the office, I saw
Lord Lansdowne, who told me (albeit not used to talk
politics with me) that what I had said to John Russell had
had such an effect upon him, that he had determined, as he
(Lord Lansdowne) thought very unwisely, and much to his
regret, to propose the renewal for six months only instead
of for a year as had been intended. I was exceedingly
annoyed at this, and told Lord Lansdowne that Lord John
must have misunderstood me, or exaggerated the importance
of what I had said, and I hoped it was not too late to
revert to the original intention, as I was quite certain there
was no necessity for limiting the period, and that if there
was opposition from any quarter, it would be as great for
six months as for twelve. He begged me to go to John
Russell at the House of Commons and say so to him, which
I did; but he said merely that they had resolved to adopt a
former precedent, and should take it for six months. In
the evening I saw Lord Lansdowne, who was evidently
extremely mortified and disappointed, and said to me, 'I
think we have made a great mess of it,' which was a great
deal for him. All this proves that there has been considerable
difference of opinion in the Cabinet, and it shows a
vacillation and infirmity of purpose, which has been all along
the besetting sin of this Government.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 9th.</i>&mdash;It appears that the change from twelve
to six months was a sudden turn of Lord John's under the
influence of fear. He had got it into his head that there
would be a strong opposition to the longer period, but not
to the shorter. Accordingly at two o'clock on Tuesday he
summoned his Cabinet, and to the great astonishment of
all or most of them, announced his intention to make this
alteration. There was evidently a considerable struggle.
Clanricarde told me he did not believe the Bill was necessary
at all, and he would rather have let it drop. Labouchere
owned yesterday morning it was all wrong. George
Grey and Wood evidently went with Lord John.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISTRESS IN IRELAND.</div>

<p>On Wednesday night the Government found themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
in a great dilemma. When Charles Wood proposed his
grant of 50,000<i>l.</i> he had no idea of meeting with any
opposition, for he told me he was not sure whether he should
<i>give</i> the Irish 50,000<i>l.</i> or 100,000<i>l.</i>; but the English members
and constituencies have become savage and hard-hearted
towards the Irish, and one after another of all parties
jumped up and opposed the grant. Graham said he was for
giving it, with the understanding that it should be the last,
whereas Charles Wood proposed it as the first of a series of
grants. Nobody knows whether it will be carried or not, but
it is quite certain that nothing more will be given, let the
consequences be what they may. Meanwhile the state of
things is monstrous and appalling.</p>

<p>Ireland is like a strong man with an enormous cancer in
one limb of his body. The distress is confined to particular
districts, but there it is frightful and apparently irremediable.
It is like a region desolated by pestilence and war. The people
really are dying of hunger, and the means of aiding them do
not exist. Here is a country, part and parcel of England, a
few hours removed from the richest and most civilised community
in the world, in a state so savage, barbarous, and
destitute, that we must go back to the Middle Ages or to the
most inhospitable regions of the globe to look for a parallel.
Nobody knows what to do; everybody hints at some scheme
or plan to which his next neighbour objects. Most people
are inclined to consider the case as hopeless, to rest on that
conviction, and let the evil work itself out, like a consuming
fire, which dies away when there is nothing left for it to
destroy. All call on the Government for a plan and a
remedy, but the Government have no plan and no remedy;
there is nothing but disagreement among them; and while
they are discussing and disputing, the masses are dying.
God only knows what is to be the end of all this, and how
and when Ireland is to recover from such a deplorable
calamity. Lord Lansdowne, a great Irish proprietor, is filled
with horror and dread at the scheme that some propound, of
making the sound part of Ireland rateable for the necessities
of the unsound, which he thinks is neither more nor less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
than a scheme of confiscation, by which the weak will not
be saved, but the strong be involved in the general ruin.
Charles Wood has all along set his face against giving or
lending money, or any Government interference in the
capacity of capitalist, and he contemplates (with what seems
like very cruelty, though he is not really cruel) that misery
and distress should run their course; that such havoc should
be made amongst the landed proprietors, that the price of
land will at last fall so low as to tempt capitalists to invest
their funds therein, and then that the country will begin to
revive, and a new condition of prosperity spring from the
ruin of the present possessors. This may, supposing it to
answer, prove the ultimate regeneration of Ireland; but it
will be at a cost of suffering to the actual possessors and to
the whole of the present generation such as never was contemplated
by any system of policy. Lord Lansdowne thinks
Trevelyan<a href="#Footnote_85" id="FNanchor_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
is the real author of this scheme, who, he tells
me, has acquired a great influence over Charles Wood's
mind.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 11th.</i>&mdash;I heard from Clarendon last night. He
takes the matter of the Habeas Corpus more quietly than I
expected, but he says, 'I thank you for telling me the cause
of what I consider great vacillation and cowardice on the
part of the Government. In the speeches there is no
evidence of opposition that could justify a Government in
turning away from its purpose.'</p>

<p>Madame de Flahault told me an anecdote about the new
French Ambassador, Admiral Cécille, creditable to all the
parties concerned. When the Embassy here was offered
him, he told the President that he had always been attached
to Louis Philippe, and if he was to be made the instrument
of saying or doing anything disagreeable to him or his
family, he could not accept it. The President said he might
be perfectly easy on that score, and that he might go and
pay his respects at Claremont as soon as he arrived if he
pleased. Accordingly the Admiral sent to the King to offer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
to wait on him, but Louis Philippe very sensibly said it
would only place him in a position of embarrassment, and
that he had better not come. I met Duchâtel at dinner on
Thursday at Lansdowne House. He spoke highly of the
French Ministry and of the President, and he evidently
thinks the Monarchy or Empire is more likely to be revived
in his person than in that of any other candidate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CEYLON COMMITTEE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 15th.</i>&mdash;The Government got good divisions the
other night on their Irish questions. Graham told me (the
morning of the discussion) that he would strongly advise
them to make a declaration of their intention to revise local
taxation, and connect that question with the Poor Laws. I
wrote Charles Wood word what he said, and John Russell
acted on the advice. Lord Lansdowne did not conceal from
me his disgust at the resolution to which the Cabinet had
come of proposing a sort of rate which is to embrace under
certain restrictions all Ireland.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 24th.</i>&mdash;Last Tuesday was as disastrous a night
as any Government ever suffered, for it was injurious and
humiliating. Baillie<a href="#Footnote_86" id="FNanchor_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
had given notice of a motion for a
Committee of Enquiry into the administration of Ceylon,
British Guiana, and Mauritius, with a view to their better
government. He afterwards withdrew Mauritius, and the
Government resolved to give the Committee about the other
two; and they did this, though they knew that what was
really meant was an attack on Lord Torrington<a href="#Footnote_87" id="FNanchor_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> about
Ceylon, and on Lord Grey on both scores. Ellice and I
told Grey, whom we met at dinner the day before, that they
ought not to give the Committee; but he seemed to be all
for it, whether <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="willing">nolens</i> or <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="unwilling">volens</i> I know not. On Tuesday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
night this motion came on, when Baillie made the most
bitter and abusive speech that could be uttered. He said
that he meant it as a vote of censure, and he accused Lord
Grey (who was sitting under the gallery all the time) of the
most disgraceful and dishonourable conduct, especially in
reference to the celebrated Jamaica Memorial in the House
of Commons last year. The House went with Baillie, and
against Grey and Torrington. The Government met the
case in a very poor, blundering, low way; a sort of dodge
was attempted and totally failed in the shape of an amendment
proposed by Ricardo. Peel said a few damaging words,
and John Russell made a very poor speech, which had all the
air of throwing Grey over. The motion for a Committee was
carried without any division or resistance, and with scarcely
any alteration. The effect was as bad as it could possibly be.
The Government and their people were mortified and dejected,
Grey immensely disgusted, and the Opposition, especially
Protectionists, insolent and elated. It is generally
believed that if they had divided, they would have been
beaten, for all the scattered sections of the Opposition and
some of their own friends would have voted against them,
and this has revealed the disagreeable truth that they have
in fact no hold in the House of Commons, no certain
majority, and that whenever all the other parties can find a
common ground to meet upon, the Government are sure to
be beaten.</p>

<p>Graham called on me on Thursday to talk over this
debate. He thought it very damaging and very bad; John
Russell wretched; he thought after Baillie's speech he ought
to have refused the Committee and abided by the consequences,
standing up and manfully defending both his colleague
and his employé. He said he had observed that Peel
had latterly been more ill-natured to the Government, and
that he still bitterly resented Lord John's speech reviving
the old dispute on the Appropriation Clause. Lord Aberdeen
says the same thing, adding that Peel had never liked Lord
John, and that he thought his conduct in attacking him,
after the support he had given him, was very bad, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
resented it accordingly, and this was not the last proof he
would give of his resentment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BREACH OF NEUTRALITY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;A day or two ago Bankes asked a question
in the House of Commons about the stores furnished to the
revolutionary Sicilian Government, to which Palmerston
made a reply, and the matter dropped. It is very singular
that none of the Opposition leaders got hold of it, for there
never was a stronger case coupled with all the rest of Palmerston's
Sicilian doings. They have so entirely mismanaged
their case, and contrived to give him so great a
triumph, and to establish such a prestige of his success and
dexterity, that it is now difficult, if not impossible, to take
the field against him afresh with any prospect of success.
But the Sicilian case is so strong and so bad, that even now,
when the papers are published, they may make a good deal
of it, and do Palmerston some damage if they manage the
case well. His case for the maritime interference after the
capture of Messina has been thrown over completely by the
speech of General Filangieri in the Neapolitan Parliament,
which bears every mark of truth; and I have since heard
how he got up the story of atrocities supposed to be committed,
which he put into the mouth of the Queen in her
speech in Parliament, and which he repeated himself with so
much effrontery in the House of Commons, and made Lord
Lansdowne so innocently repeat in the House of Lords.
Long after, I believe two months after the intervention, he
wrote to Lord Napier, and desired him to instruct the
British Consul at Messina to collect details of the Neapolitan
atrocities, and to send them to him, and this was the evidence
on which he made the statements which so materially assisted
in carrying him through the debate the first night of the
session. The mention in the Queen's Speech of the 'King
of <i>Naples</i>,' instead of the King of the Two Sicilies, is now
said to have been a mere inadvertence, but I have no doubt
it was overlooked by his colleagues, but put in by him intentionally
and with a significant purpose. It is his whole antecedent
conduct from first to last which confers such importance
on the case of the stores. Sicilian agents came over here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
and applied to the Government contractor to supply them, with
stores. He said he had none ready, having just supplied all
he had to Government, but that if Government would let
him have them back, he would supply them to the agents,
and replace the Government stores in a short time. The
Sicilians had no time to lose, and by their desire the contractor
applied to the Ordnance, stating the object of his
application. If the matter had been merely treated commercially,
and the contractor, without stating his object,
had asked the Government to oblige him as a convenience to
himself, it would have been quite harmless; but the object
having been stated, it became a political matter. So the
Ordnance considered it, and they referred the request to
Palmerston as Foreign Secretary, who gave his sanction to
the transaction. This made the whole thing a political
affair, and a direct assistance rendered by Government to the
Sicilian insurgents. The Neapolitan Minister heard of it,
and an apology to his Government became necessary. All
the Ministers saw the gravity of this matter, but by the
extraordinary good fortune which never deserts Palmerston,
nobody found it out, and not a word was said about it the
first night, to the great joy and surprise of the Ministers,
who were trembling lest this delicate point should be touched
upon.<a href="#Footnote_88" id="FNanchor_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF CHILLIANWALLAH.</div>

<p>The rate in aid for Ireland is making a great stir and
very bad blood in Ireland. The evidence before both Committees
is very much against it. Labouchere told me yesterday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
that the Commons Committee had been much shaken
by the evidence of one of the Poor Law Commissioners examined
before them yesterday, and the same effect has been
produced in the House of Lords. Lord Lansdowne cannot
endure it, and, though it is a Government measure, the
Cabinet are anything but unanimous about it. Clarendon
does not like it either, but he must have money, <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="by any means">quocunque

<p>In the midst of more important affairs the exposure that
has just been made of Hudson's railway delinquency<a href="#Footnote_89" id="FNanchor_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> has
excited a great sensation, and no small satisfaction. In the
City all seem glad of his fall, and most people rejoice at
the degradation of a purse-proud, vulgar upstart, who had
nothing to recommend him but his ill-gotten wealth. But
the people who ought to feel most degraded are those who
were foolish or mean enough to subscribe to the 'Hudson Testimonial,'
and all the greedy, needy, fine people, who paid
abject court to him in order to obtain slices of his good things.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 7th.</i>&mdash;The news from India of Gough's disastrous
and stupid battle<a href="#Footnote_90" id="FNanchor_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> filled everybody with indignation and
dismay, and a universal cry arose for Sir Charles Napier.
On Saturday evening I met Lord John Russell at Lord
Granville's, and told him so, entreating him to send him
out. He answered, in his cold, easy way, that 'it was too
late now,' that the campaign could not last beyond the end
of this month or middle of the next, and that he therefore
could not get out in time; that they had appointed Sir
William Gomm, and that the Duke of Wellington gave him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
a high character, and he thought all would do well; in
short, he seemed not inclined to do anything.</p>

<p>On Sunday I called on Arbuthnot at Apsley House, where
I found the Duke. I talked to him of the battle; he shook
his head, and lifted up his hands. I said they ought to send
out Napier; he said he had long ago wanted to do so, that
now he could not get out till the campaign was over; that
he hoped it would all end well, though it had been a bad
affair, and ill-managed. I asked him would Napier go if
they would appoint him. He said, 'Oh yes; he would go,
he would go,' he repeated. He then went away. When he
was gone, Arbuthnot said to me, 'Though the Duke puts a
good face upon it, and endeavours to make the best of it, I
can tell you (though he will not say so to you or to anybody)
that he is extremely alarmed, and thinks the state of
things most serious.' He then said that the Duke would
like exceedingly to send out Napier, but that he would express
no opinion, and give no advice; that he always said he
was not a Cabinet Minister, and it was not for him to tender
advice, but he would give it if it was asked. I said I had
spoken to John Russell the evening before, when Arbuthnot
said, if I could do anything with the Government to induce
them to send Napier out, it would be doing a great service,
and he knew that the Duke would afford every assistance in
his power for that purpose. I said I would try. I determined
to go and speak to Hobhouse.<a href="#Footnote_91" id="FNanchor_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> In my way to Brooks',
where I went to look for him, I met Lord Lansdowne, when
I urged him to send out Napier. He said he would not go.
I told him I knew he would, and then repeated what had
passed at Apsley House. He said John Russell had seen
the Duke the day before, who had said nothing about it.
I told him the Duke would not say anything unless he was
asked, but then he would, and would give his opinion. I
then went to Hobhouse, found him, and urged him, as
strongly as I could, to send Napier out, telling him how
clamorous everybody was for it, and what the Duke and
Arbuthnot had said to me. He acknowledged that it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
the only thing to do, but that he did not know how the
Directors were to be brought to consent to it, and that his
having the seat in Council or not made the difference
between 8,000<i>l.</i> or 18,000<i>l.</i> a year to him, to say nothing
of the insult which Napier considered would be put upon
him by excluding him from the Council. Hobhouse then
said, 'You do not know the difficulties I have had with
these men. I have brought the Government, the Duke
of Wellington, and the Queen all to bear upon them, and
all in vain. It was only the other day, after the affair in
which Cureton was killed, that I made another attempt. I
sent to Sir James Lushington, and asked him if it was not
then possible to send Napier out to India. The next day he
sent me word that it was impossible, for if it was proposed
<i>not one man</i> would vote for it.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR CHARLES NAPIER SENT TO INDIA.</div>

<p>I replied, since all the powers had failed, that I would
bring one more to bear upon them, viz. the House of Commons,
and advised him to go down and announce the appointment
of Napier as Commander-in-Chief; and if the
Directors refused the seat in Council, to cast all the responsibility
on them, and ask Parliament for the additional
salary. He approved of the plan, if it should become necessary.
I ended by urging him to probe the Duke of Wellington,
who would tell him his real opinion (he was to see him
the next morning), and then to take a decisive step, and
send Napier out. I told him his Government wanted credit,
and that while in the event of any fresh disasters they would
incur an enormous responsibility, and be called to a severe
account for not having sent the best man they could find,
by doing so now, they would acquire reputation, vigour, and
resolution. The next morning early he went to Lord John
Russell, and they agreed to appoint Napier. Hobhouse
went to the Duke, and it was settled at once, greatly to the
Duke's satisfaction. Napier, however, took twelve hours to
consider of it, and the Duke told me he did not at all like it.
The Directors behaved well, and, whether agreeable to them
or not, they acquiesced with a good grace. Ellenborough
advised Napier to demand powers greater than had ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
been given to any commander-in-chief, but Napier consulted
Hardinge, who advised him to do no such thing.
He said there was no necessity for them, and that he had
much better go out as all his predecessors had done. This
was sound advice, and Napier took it. It would have been
most unwise in a man appointed under such circumstances
to make extraordinary demands upon the authority which
only with the greatest reluctance could be induced to give
him any powers at all. Hardinge told me this in the House
of Lords last night.</p>

<p>The satisfaction at Napier's appointment is great and
universal, but I really believe it is in a considerable degree
attributable to the accident of my seeing the Duke on
Sunday, and bringing him and the Government to an understanding
on the subject. If I had not seen Hobhouse on
Sunday afternoon, I doubt if any change would have been
made, and am inclined to think Gomm's appointment would
have been carried out.</p>

<p>Last night in the House of Lords Palmerston got the
hardest hit he has ever yet had, though his skin is so impenetrably
thick that he will hardly feel it. Some nights
ago Bankes had asked a question about the Sicilian arms,
which Palmerston answered in his usual offhand way, and
as usual the matter fell flat, nobody appearing to think
or care anything about it. Palmerston made a sort of
explanation, such as it was, without a word in it of regret
or excuse, as if it had been all quite natural and right. But
the matter did not go off so easily in the Lords. Stanley
stated the case he had heard, and asked if it was true.
Lord Lansdowne at once owned it was true; he called it
'an inadvertence'! But he said that as soon as it was
known to the Cabinet, they were deliberately of opinion
that the permission ought to have been withheld, and that
instructions had been sent to Temple in case any complaint
was made, to apologise, explain, and promise nothing of
the sort should ever recur. A more mortifying declaration
for Palmerston (if anything can mortify him) could not well
be, and it was besides an exposure not to be mistaken. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
this affair had stood alone, it might have passed for an inadvertence,
but conjoined with all the other circumstances of
the case, and the general tenor of Palmerston's Italian policy,
nothing can well be worse. Palmerston is <i>safe</i> enough as
far as his office is concerned, and the Government will not
be shaken, but it is damaging beyond all doubt, and when
the question comes to be regularly discussed, Stanley, though
now too late, will give him a tremendous dressing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFFAIR OF THE SICILIAN ARMS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 16th.</i>&mdash;I have been entirely occupied with the
labour and trouble of migration from Grosvenor Place to
Bruton Street, where I took up my abode yesterday evening,
and the consequence is that I have not found time to write
a line about passing events.<a href="#Footnote_92" id="FNanchor_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>A day or two after Lord Lansdowne's explanation in the
House of Lords about the Sicilian arms Bankes made another
interpellation in the House of Commons, the object of which
was to ask the same question that Stanley had done. But
unlike his chief he made a long, rambling, stupid speech,
which gave Palmerston one of those opportunities of which
he never fails to avail himself with so much dexterity, and
accordingly he delivered a slashing, impudent speech, full of
sarcasm, jokes, and clap-traps, the whole eminently successful.
He quizzed Bankes unmercifully, he expressed ultra-Liberal
sentiments to please the Radicals, and he gathered
shouts of laughter and applause as he dashed and rattled
along. He scarcely deigned to notice <i>the</i> question, merely
saying a few words at the end of his speech in replying to
it. All this did perfectly well for the House of Commons,
and he got the honours of the day. Stanley was furious,
and all the Anti-Palmerstonians provoked to death, while
he and his friends chuckled and laughed in their sleeves.
John Russell also came to his rescue, and made an apology
for him, which in his mouth was very discreditable, for it
was in fact inconsistent with what Lord Lansdowne had said
in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, March 16th, 1849.</i>&mdash;On Thursday in last week
Mr. Disraeli made his promised display in favour of the
landed interest. His speech was vehemently praised by the
Tories, but regarded with very different opinions by different
people; on the whole it was not much admired. The
night before last, the debate having been adjourned for
several days, Charles Wood answered it in one of the best
speeches that has been heard for a long time, and by far
the best he ever made. Peel warmly congratulated him,
and he told Ellice it was not merely a good, it was a great
speech. This has been very useful to the Government as
well as to the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself, and
both required something of credit. The Government are
(as heretofore) hampered with measures which they have
brought forward with very doubtful means of being able to
carry them. The Rate in Aid and the Navigation Laws
are both in jeopardy, though this time by no fault of the
Government, who have done all they could to pass both. It
is a state of things full of difficulty and uncertainty. Every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
party is strong enough to thwart and embarrass its opponents,
and to obstruct and damage measures it dislikes,
and none is strong enough to have its own way, and carry
matters with a high hand. All this was foreseen as the
inevitable result of the Reform Bill, but so many years
elapsed during which peculiar circumstances prevented the
actual occurrence of the result, that people forgot the prediction,
and everybody fancied matters were to be carried
on exactly as they used to be before the Reform Bill had
destroyed the machinery of rotten boroughs, and let in a
flood of popular influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CLOUD IN THE EAST.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 20th.</i>&mdash;The complication of foreign affairs is not
a little increased by the bad humour into which we have
thrown the Emperor of Russia by our proceedings at Constantinople.
Brunnow, generally so <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rose colored">couleur de rose</i> and such
a fast friend of Palmerston, holds language quite unusual
with him. Graham told me he met him at a great dinner
of diplomats and politicians at Aberdeen's last Wednesday,
when he talked to him with much vehemence and in a very
menacing tone. The case is this:&mdash;By the treaty of Ackerman
the Hospodars in the provinces are elected for seven years,
by that of Adrianople the election is for life. The Emperor
desired to revert to this former mode, and proposed it to
the Turks. They were disposed to consent, when Stratford
Canning interposed, prevailed on them to refuse, and so
excited them that they assumed a military attitude and
began to arm. This is Brunnow's version of the affair; at
the same time intimating that he attributed it more to
Stratford Canning than to Palmerston himself. It is well
known that Stratford Canning is strongly anti-Russian, both
politically and personally, but I don't believe he would take
any serious course without being assured of Palmerston's concurrence;
and Eddisbury<a href="#Footnote_93" id="FNanchor_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
told me he had done quite right.
We suppose that Russia and Austria have a perfect understanding,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
and if it be so, this is the result of Palmerston's
having quarrelled with Austria.</p>

<p>While clouds are gathering in that quarter, and the
Hungarian war seems far from its termination, the Danes
have denounced their armistice, and the King of Sardinia
his, the Sicilians seem resolved to reject the King of Naples'
terms, and war is about to break again with fresh fury
over half of Europe, France and England alone remaining
at peace within themselves, with each other, and with all
the world.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 25th.</i>&mdash;Lord Aberdeen made a strong attack on
Palmerston on Thursday night about the affairs of Piedmont,
denouncing his partiality for Sardinia and against Austria,
and particularly his suppression of an important despatch in
the papers he had laid before Parliament at the beginning
of the last session. Lord Lansdowne replied with his usual
spirit, but he could not parry the attack, and was reduced to
the necessity of making a somewhat discreditable defence.
Brougham rose afterwards and lashed the whole transaction,
and there it ended; but Lord John was amazed at what
had occurred, and said that he never saw the Blue Books
before they are presented, and therefore had not known what
was put before Parliament and what was not. It was a very
damaging discussion to Palmerston, as far as <i>character</i> is concerned,
but he does not mind that sort of damage, and no
other can be done to him.</p>

<p>The Government are dissatisfied with Dalhousie,<a href="#Footnote_94" id="FNanchor_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and it
appears to be in agitation to recall him. Hobhouse told me
that Napier had proposed to him to make him (Napier)
Governor-General. It was not indeed a formal proposal, but
he said, 'Why don't you make me Governor-General at
once?' They would have given him a peerage if he had
insisted on it as the condition of his going to India, but this
he did not know. When the command was offered him, he
would not give his answer without twenty-four hours' consideration,
in spite of all pressing to accept at once. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Directors swallowed the pill with a good grace enough.
Three of them voted against his having a seat in Council,
the rest agreed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PEERAGE SUGGESTED FOR LORD JOHN.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 30th.</i>&mdash;At Althorp the last three days, for Northampton
races. The day before I went there I sate for two
hours with Sir James Graham, who was very serious and
very sad about everything, more especially Ireland and
India. I think he now regrets not having gone to India,
and would go if it were again offered him. He is now prodigiously
alarmed at the opposition the Rate in Aid is meeting
with from the Northern Irish, and greatly staggered
by Twistleton's<a id="FNanchor_95"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
evidence and resignation, in short he is
shrinking from his original opinions on this subject, expressed
a great wish to talk to Clarendon, and discussed
Palmerston and foreign affairs, <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="and many others">cum multis aliis</i>. Amongst
other things he spoke of the conduct of the Chancellor to
Romilly, Solicitor-General, about the report of a committee,
of which Romilly was chairman last year, to enquire into
legal abuses. Romilly had drawn up a report, and he said
because it affected the Master's offices, the Chancellor insisted
on burking it, and frightened Romilly from going on
with it. As he made it out, it was a very bad case.</p>

<p>Graham talked much of John Russell, and said his loss
would be so great that if he was unable to face the severe
work of the House of Commons, he had better go to the
Lords and retain his office. At Althorp I told the Duke of
Bedford all that had passed between Graham and me. He
was so much struck by what he had said about Lord John,
which chimed in with his own feelings, that he resolved to
write to him and propose to him to take this course, and
the next morning he told me he had done so; and that he
intended, if Lord John did it, with Tavistock's assent to
make him a sufficient dotation. This is so great an object
for him and for his son, that it will probably reconcile him
in great measure to the sacrifice of quitting the House of
Commons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>Yesterday came the news of the defeat of the Sardinians<a href="#Footnote_96" id="FNanchor_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
and the abdication of Charles Albert, which was received
with universal joy, everybody rejoicing at it except Palmerston,
who will be excessively provoked and disappointed,
though he will not venture, and is too clever, to show it.
Clarendon had a conversation with him a few days ago,
in which he told Palmerston how much he wished that
Radetzky might crush the King of Sardinia, when Palmerston
did not disguise the difference of his own opinions,
and his wishes that the Austrians might be defeated. Yesterday
there was a Drawing-room, at which everybody, the
Queen included, complimented and wished joy to Colloredo,
except Palmerston, who, though he spoke to him about
other things, never alluded to the news that had just arrived
from Italy. I met Colloredo at Madame de Lieven's
(who was in a state of rapturous excitement), and he told
us so there. Nothing could be more striking than this
marked difference between the Foreign Secretary and his
Sovereign, and all his countrymen, and we may be sure
Colloredo will not fail to make a pretty story of it to his
Court. The moral, however, is deplorable, for while it must
satisfy the Austrians that England has no bad feeling
towards Austria but the reverse, they cannot but see that
Palmerston is permitted to drag the English Government
and nation wherever it pleases his crotchets, caprices, or
prejudices to make them go. I certainly never saw a more
general expression of satisfaction than the intelligence of
Radetzky's victory excited here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NAVIGATION LAWS.</div>

<p>While I was at Althorp the Duke of Bedford showed me
two letters, which Hobhouse had sent him, of the Duke of
Wellington's to Dalhousie, containing his advice and opinions
on the conduct of the war in the Punjaub, which are admirable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
and show that his mind is as vigorous, comprehensive,
and sagacious as ever.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 1st.</i>&mdash;I do not think anything Palmerston has done
has excited so great a sensation, and exposed him to so much
animadversion, as his behaviour to Colloredo at the Drawing-room
the day on which the news of Radetzky's victory
arrived. Everybody is talking of it; Clarendon told Lord
Lansdowne of it, who was both shocked and surprised. The
impolicy of this unmistakeable display of <i>animus</i> is the
more striking, because we are now (through Ponsonby) entreating
the Austrian Government to show moderation, and
not to exact large contributions. This is not the first time
men have suffered more from their small misdeeds than
from their great ones.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford told me yesterday that Lord John
had taken in very good part his proposal, and had promised
to discuss the matter with him, but said very justly that he
must not quit the House of Commons without a clear necessity,
and that it would be very inexpedient to go to the
House of Lords just at the moment when a decision of that
House may possibly upset the Government. This may take
place on the Navigation Laws, for the Government have
made up their minds to resign if they are beaten upon it,
and Lord John was to propose to the Cabinet that Lord
Lansdowne should announce their intention in the House
of Lords. Meanwhile it is understood that Lord Stanley
means to beat them if he can, and is prepared to take the
Government if it is offered to him. The Queen asked
Graham the other night if it was true that Stanley really
did mean it, and he told her he believed it certainly was
true. She then asked him what would be the consequence.
He said a struggle between the aristocracy and the democracy
of the country, very perilous to the former. She said
she entirely agreed in this opinion. Lord John Russell sent
on Friday for Ellesmere, and asked him to go and talk to
the Duke of Wellington, who is going to vote against the
repeal, for they justly think that though he would probably
not carry many votes with him if he went with Government,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
he would carry a good many if he went against
them.</p>

<p>Clarendon has had two interviews with Graham with
very full, frank, and amicable discussion on all points.
Clarendon is struck with his great sagacity, and at the same
time with a pusillanimity which goes far to neutralise that
sagacity. I have remarked this myself, and that his judgement
is often blinded by his fears. We certainly may be
approaching a very serious crisis, but nothing will make me
believe, till I see it, that Stanley and his crew will come into
power, and that the Queen will be reduced to the deplorable
necessity, and even degradation, of taking such a pack as
he would offer her, and of dissolving Parliament at their
bidding. That she would struggle to avert such a calamity,
and appeal to all the statesmen of both parties to save her,
I do not doubt, but there would appear the fatal obstacle of
Palmerston, for assuredly nobody will join in any new arrangement
by which he would remain at the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Reeve, who is just come back from Paris, gives a very
unsatisfactory account of the state of things there, and of
the miserable uncertainty about everything and everybody
in which the country is involved. He says that notwithstanding
our close alliance and apparent intimacy, there is
really no amicable feeling towards us, but on the contrary
great jealousy and secret ill-will. They have no more confidence
in our diplomacy than the Powers whom we have
sacrificed to the French connexion, and any incident may
any day put an end to this connexion. There is absolutely
no Government, Odilon Barrot has no weight, influence, or
capacity; the President is not unpopular, and that is all
that can be said of him. The army <i>they hope</i> is still firm,
but the greatest efforts are made to corrupt the soldiers,
and they read Prudhomme's atrocious journal. He does
not think that all France is so resolutely pacific as we fancy,
and that a little matter might again kindle a warlike spirit;
in short, it is a state of things full of uncertainty and therefore
of danger. Thiers is said to have fallen into the lowest
discredit. He is now known to have shown great cowardice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
on February 24th, and this, which Frenchmen never forgive,
together with his recent vacillating conduct, has had a fatal
effect on his influence and position, and as he has quarrelled
more or less with most of his old friends, he is entirely
without political power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRISH RELIEF.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;It has been settled between Clarendon, John
Russell, and Charles Wood to give up the Rate in Aid and
impose on the Irish the income tax, which it is said they
prefer. The two Ministers wanted the Irish income tax
to be for three years instead of putting it exactly on the same
footing as the English. This Clarendon stoutly opposed,
representing the extreme impolicy of making any difference,
and he at last, but not without difficulty, made them give
way. On Thursday last Peel made a great speech, bringing
forward very elaborately his views of Irish relief, but without
explaining <i>how</i> his plan was to be carried out. Graham is
dead against him, so much so that they have had no conversation
on the subject. Clarendon is equally against him,
as are the Government, but Clarendon determined to see
him and talk it over with him. They met at Palmerston's
on Saturday night, when Peel treated Clarendon with extraordinary
cordiality, and Clarendon proposed an interview,
which is to take place at Peel's house to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>Ellesmere went to the Duke of Wellington to talk to him
about the Navigation Bill, and found him in excellent disposition.
He promised to do all in his power to support the
Government, and he advised Prince Albert, who called on
him a day or two ago, to keep quiet and say as little as
possible on the subject to anybody.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 4th.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford told me yesterday
morning that Lord John has made up his mind to go to
the House of Lords, but that he will not have the Peerage
continued to his son. His purpose is to be created with
remainder to the Duke. He disapproves of poor Peerages,
of men being created without ample patrimonies, and the
property which the Duke means to settle on Lord John (he
did not tell me the amount or locality, only that it is a good
gentleman's property) he does not consider enough for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Peerage. I know not whether he will adhere to this resolution,
which, if he does, will form a new precedent. It has
only been mentioned to Lord Lansdowne, whose disposition
is to retire, but they will never allow him, for his continuing
with them is of the greatest consequence to the Government
and to Lord John himself; his loss would be irreparable in
all ways.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 6th.</i>&mdash;Lord Clarendon<a href="#Footnote_97" id="FNanchor_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> had a long interview with
Peel, who received him with the greatest cordiality and even
warmth. Their conversation was to the last degree open
and friendly, and Peel professed the most earnest desire to
do anything in his power to co-operate with Clarendon in
doing good to Ireland. They discussed Peel's plans, and
Clarendon stated to him frankly all his objections to them,
and why a great part of them was quite impracticable. All
this Peel received with the utmost candour and goodwill,
and Clarendon told me he thought he had completely succeeded
in proving to him that much that he proposed (the
Commission particularly) was quite impossible. I never saw
a man more satisfied than he was at this interview, or more
gratified at Peel's reception of him. Peel entreated him with
the greatest earnestness not to think of leaving Ireland till
he had accomplished something great and important towards
the regeneration of the country. This, however, Clarendon
is not very sanguine as to his power of doing with the
present Government. His indignation against his own
political friends is boundless.<a href="#Footnote_98" id="FNanchor_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> He poured it all out to me
the other night, and he is equally indignant about the
past and hopeless about the future; hopeless, because John
Russell is so infirm of purpose, that he will not predominate
over his Cabinet and prevent the chaos of opinions and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
interests which prevent anything Clarendon proposes being
done. Then he says that the Chancellor is a great mortgagee
in Ireland, and on account of his own personal interests
he resolutely opposes all the plans relating to the transfer
of property which by any possibility can affect the mortgagees.
Lansdowne and Clanricarde are both Irish proprietors,
so they have their own separate interests. The
consequence of all this confusion is that he is continually
thwarted and baffled in his endeavours to carry measures he
thinks essential to the relief of Ireland, and he assures me
that he has all along predicted to John Russell and George
Grey exactly what has happened. The measures which the
Government are now finding themselves obliged to adopt are
the very same which he originally proposed and which they
rejected. He appears not to have minced matters with John
Russell, but to have spoken his mind freely, and visited upon
the Cabinet in most unsparing criticism and reproach all
their sins of omission and commission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LANDED INTERESTS IN IRELAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Thursday, May 11th (Bruton Street).</i>&mdash;For the last fortnight
everybody has been occupied with the division in the
House of Lords on the Navigation Bill; the greatest whip-up
was made on both sides that ever was known, and the
lists made and re-made out with such accuracy that every
vote was pretty well ascertained, and the numbers quite
correctly calculated.<a href="#Footnote_99" id="FNanchor_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
Stanley made a magnificent speech,
the best it is said he ever made, and one of the most
brilliant and effective ever made by anybody. He made a
sort of attack on the Duke of Wellington which was both
unjustifiable and in bad taste. The Duke behaved oddly in
this matter. He gave repeated assurances to the Government
that he would assist them in every way he could, but
he really gave them no assistance at all, for he refused
positively to communicate with any Peers on the subject,
would not speak to those who wished to consult him, and
he never opened his lips in the debate. I am compelled to
believe that Stanley really meant, if he could have defeated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
this Bill, to have taken the Government if offered to
him.</p>

<p>The Protectionists are gone mad with the notion of reaction
in the country against Free Trade. Many people,
however, say that distress really has produced a very considerable
change of opinion, and it is allowed on all hands
that in the event of a dissolution the Irish, frantic with
distress, would support any Protectionist Government to a
man. We hear that Stanley means to overturn the Bill in
Committee, as he undoubtedly can, and that the Government
will be compelled to restore its integrity again on the report,
and this is to be the future progress of the contest.</p>

<p>On Monday night a great event occurred in the House
of Commons. Young Peel, Sir Robert's second son,<a href="#Footnote_100" id="FNanchor_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> made
a maiden speech (on the Jew Bill) of such extraordinary
merit, that it at once placed him at the top of the tree. Its
excellence and its great promise were universally admitted.
Peel came into the House just at the close of it, and it is
said that neither he nor Lady Peel had any idea their son
was going to speak. The appearance of a young man who
promises something great, is in these days of mediocrity an
occurrence of enormous value and importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SUPPRESSED DESPATCH.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 21st.</i>&mdash;I have been too much occupied with the
Derby and Oaks to write about political matters, but I cannot
omit a fresh Palmerstonian affair, as bad or worse than
any which have preceded it. On Monday last Lord Lansdowne
in reply to a question of Beaumont's said, that 'no
communication whatever had been made by the Austrian
Government to ours relative to their intervention in Italy,'
the fact being that Colloredo had five or six days before
gone to Palmerston, and communicated to him by order of
his Government their motives, objects, and intentions, as to
Italian intervention in great detail. This communication
he never imparted to his colleagues, and Lord Lansdowne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
was consequently ignorant of it. On Tuesday the newspapers
reported Lord Lansdowne's answer, on which Colloredo
went to Palmerston to complain of it. At the Queen's
ball on Wednesday night, Colloredo spoke to Lord Lansdowne
and asked him why he had said what he did. Lord
Lansdowne had nothing for it but to acknowledge his
ignorance. On Friday, the first day on which the House
met, I heard what had passed between Colloredo and Palmerston.
I resolved to go to Lord Lansdowne. I found
him at Lansdowne House, just going to the House of Lords.
I began to tell him the object of my calling on him. He
stopped me, said he knew all about it, that he was going to
the House to correct his former statement, and 'to make the
best excuse he could,' that it was exceedingly disagreeable,
and the more unaccountable as he had taken the precaution
on Monday before he went to the House of Lords to answer
Beaumont, to send to the Foreign Office to enquire whether
any communication had been received, and the reply was,
'None whatever.' On reference to Palmerston he had said
that 'he had quite forgotten it,' and Lord Lansdowne told
me that John Russell was as much in ignorance of it as he
was himself. I saw that he was exceedingly annoyed, but
nothing seems to rouse any of them to any serious manifestation
of resentment and displeasure. This is as bad a
case as can be, but will have no more result than any of
Palmerston's other delinquencies.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 3rd.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford told me a few days
ago that the Queen had been again remonstrating about
Palmerston more strongly than ever. This was in reference
to the suppressed Austrian despatch which made such a noise.
She then sent for John Russell, and told him she could not
stand it any longer, and he must make some arrangement
to get rid of Palmerston. This communication was just as
fruitless as all her preceding ones. I don't know what Lord
John said, he certainly did not pacify her, but as usual there
it ended. But the consequence of not being able to get any
satisfaction from her Minister has been that she has poured
her feelings and her wrongs into the more sympathetic ears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
of her late Minister, and I believe that the Queen has told
Peel everything, all her own feelings and wishes, and all that
passes on the subject.</p>

<p>It is well known that Aberdeen and Stanley have for
some time meditated a vigorous and combined attack on the
foreign policy of the Government, and one day not long
since Aberdeen said that they did intend to make this
attack, that he and Stanley and Peel were all agreed on
opposition to Palmerston, that of Disraeli they were not so
sure, and that Peel, though abhorring the foreign policy, was
always in dread of doing anything to damage the Government.
Aberdeen had tried to persuade him that an attack
on Palmerston, if successful, need not affect the Government,
that it was now proved to demonstration that a Protectionist
Government was out of the question, and that an adverse
vote would turn out Palmerston, and by so doing would in
the end strengthen and not weaken the Government itself.
It has been suggested that two courses were possible; one,
that Palmerston might resign and the rest stay in, merely
filling up his place; the other, that they might all resign,
and then when it was proved, as it would be, that no other
Government could be formed, that the old one might be
reconstituted without Palmerston, and with certain changes
and modifications. The curious part of all this is the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="map of the country">carte
du pays</i> it exhibits, and the remarkable and most improper
position which Palmerston occupies <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> the Queen, his
mistress, and his own colleagues. I know not where to
look for a parallel to such a mass of anomalies, the Queen
turning from her own Prime Minister to confide in the one
who was supplanted by him; a Minister talking over quietly
and confidentially with an outsider by what circumstances
and what agency his colleague, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, might be extruded from the Government; the Queen
abhorring her Minister and unable to rid herself of him;
John Russell fascinated and subjugated by the ascendency
of Palmerston, submitting to everything from him and supporting
him right or wrong, the others not concealing from
those they are in the habit of confiding in, their disapprobation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
of the conduct and policy of their colleague, while
they are all the time supporting the latter and excusing
the former, and putting themselves under the obligation of
identifying themselves with his proceedings and standing
or falling with him. The whole thing is bad, discreditable,
and injurious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO SCOTLAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>July 29th.</i>&mdash;Two months have elapsed since I could bring
myself to write anything in this book. I was disgusted
with the occupation, nothing interested me; it was useless
to jot down the common course of events, which the newspapers
record far better, nothing of sufficient interest came
to my knowledge to make me take up my pen.</p>

<p>In fact I had got so tired of everything, and so longed for
something fresh to stimulate my jaded mind, that I resolved
to make a run into Scotland, and see Edinburgh, and as much
of the country as could be visited in a few days. I really
was ashamed of having never been in any part of Scotland.
Accordingly last Tuesday week, the 17th, I went with the
Ellesmeres to Worsley (a place I found immensely improved),
and on Thursday afternoon I proceeded to Edinburgh. On
Friday I went all about the town, new and old, going to
all the remarkable places, and clambering to the top of
Arthur's Seat; on Saturday to see Melrose and Abbotsford,
the latter a miserable humbug of a place, ugly, mean, and
not worth crossing the street to see, and yet such is the
influence of a name, that crowds of travelling pilgrims repair
to the habitation of Walter Scott. Melrose is a beautiful
ruin, but it is I dare say true that</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,</span>
<span class="i0">Go visit it by the pale moonlight.</span>
</span></p>
</div>

<p>On returning to Edinburgh, I went to the Calton Hill and
again walked about the town. On Sunday morning the
aspect of the new town was curious, it looked like a city of
the dead. In the vast and magnificent streets and squares,
there was scarcely a human being moving about or a sound
to be heard; it looked like a town newly built that had not
yet been used, and which was waiting for its inhabitants.
The effect was the oddest I ever saw as I sauntered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
about for an hour before church time. By eleven o'clock
Princes Street was swarming, for they are a church-going
people.</p>

<p>I went to hear the celebrated Dr. Candlish preach, and
was exceedingly struck with him, and with the simple and
impressive service. He is very eloquent, and I was able to
listen to a discourse above an hour long without being tired,
which is the best proof of the merit of the preacher. The
service in good hands is admirable, but all depends on the
minister, and on the whole I think such a Liturgy as ours
a preferable form of worship.</p>

<p>After church I walked about the old town, and dived
into the wynds, and examined the remnants of ancient
architecture, and of the old edifices, all very striking and
curious. In the afternoon by rail to Perth. There I met
Lord Glasgow returning from Hay Mackenzie's funeral, and
he induced me to make an appointment with him at Glasgow
on Wednesday, and go steaming up the Lochs. On
Monday morning I went to Dunkeld, walked about the
place; thence to Blair Athol, where I slept; next morning
retraced my steps through the Pass of Killiecrankie, and
along a beautiful road to Taymouth; found Breadalbane
there, who took me all over the place. It is grand and
beautiful, as fine a place as I ever saw. I could not stay,
but returned by another road along the Tay to Dunkeld, and
then back to Perth. Next morning very early by rail to
Glasgow. There I met Lord Glasgow, who had hired a
steamer, in which we started and sailed up different lochs,
ending at Tarbet, where we landed, went to the foot of Ben
Lomond, got into a boat and paddled about the lake, then
returned to Kilbirnie, a strange, old, half-neglected place,
very comfortable and exceedingly pretty, and there I slept.
Next morning started again, sailed round by Arran up Loch
Fyne to Inverary. Nothing can exceed the beauty of this
scenery, especially the approach to Inverary; the Duke and
Duchess were very civil, and pressed us to stay, but we could
not, and returned to Kilbirnie. On Friday walked about the
place, then by rail to Glasgow, looked at the town, and on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Saturday morning by express train to London. A successful
and delightful expedition; saw a great deal in a very short
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DEBATE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>August 8th.</i>&mdash;The Session closed during my absence from
London. Its last days were distinguished by a long debate
in the House of Lords on foreign affairs, and a short demonstration
got up in the House of Commons by Palmerston.
There is a <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="hidden information">dessous des cartes</i> about this affair, as follows: the
Session was drawing to a close, when the project (originally
entertained, but abandoned) of making an attack on Palmerston
and the foreign policy of the Government was resumed,
and a confederacy was formed for the purpose between
Brougham, Stanley, and Aberdeen, not without misgivings
on the part of Aberdeen and his friends, for both he and
Canning<a href="#Footnote_101" id="FNanchor_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
told me they thought it was too late, and possibly
might do more harm than good. This was a very unwise
confederacy; the only man of the three who was in earnest
was Aberdeen, and he never ought to have had anything to
do with Brougham. As soon as it was known that this field
day was in preparation, a great whip began on both sides,
and it was considerably believed that the Government would
be left in a minority. Meanwhile Lady Palmerston was
furious with Brougham, and she wrote him some very
angry and reproachful letters. Brougham had no mind
to quarrel with her. She fairly bullied him and frightened
him, and he accordingly threw over the cause he had undertaken.
He made a miserable speech, which enraged his
colleagues and all the opponents of the Government, who
swore (and it was true) that he had sold them. Aberdeen
spoke well, and Lord Lansdowne admirably. The Government
was in a minority in the House, but by dint of
proxies got a majority of twelve, so that the whole thing
was in fact a failure. A day or two after Palmerston made
his devils bring on a discussion in the House of Commons,
that he might make a speech. He replied after a fashion
to Aberdeen, that is, he made some offensive personal allusions
to him, but did not attempt to vindicate his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
conduct in the essential particulars. This exhibition was
trumpeted forth as a great Palmerstonian triumph, and the
close of the Session has left him and his spouse immoderately
jubilant. It admits of no doubt that in spite of the
enormous case there is against him, Palmerston has not
only escaped undamaged, but seems to be invested with all
the insignia of triumph. He is now evidently endeavouring
to make for himself a great Radical interest in the House
of Commons, and thus to increase his power, and render
himself more indispensable to the Government by making
them feel how dangerous he would be out of office.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>August 14th.</i>&mdash;On Wednesday last to Stoke, on Friday to
Nuneham. At Stoke we discussed the very serious question
of extension of the suffrage, and Lord John Russell's position
in relation to it. Just before the Session ended Graham
spoke to Lord John on this subject, told him it would be
one of the questions he would have to consider during the
recess, as it must occupy Parliament next Session, that he
(Graham) was prepared to support a measure of this kind,
and that he must tell Lord John that after his having upon
two occasions in the House of Commons declared himself
favourable to some extension of the suffrage, it was incumbent
on him to give effect to those declarations. It
is pretty evident that Graham (after his wont) is afraid of
not being beforehand with public opinion or clamour, and
that he is ready to advocate some Radical, or at any rate
Liberal measure. Lord John seems to be conscious that this
is a very grave matter, but he says he thinks he can frame a
good measure, and he intends to busy himself about it. I
called on Labouchere at Stoke on Thursday morning, and
had some talk with him about it. He is afraid of it, and
sees all the danger and difficulty of the question, and is not
a little disgusted that the agitation of it and the necessity
of some proposition should have been caused by John
Russell's committing himself as he chose to do in the House
of Commons. Labouchere spoke also with much disapprobation
of Palmerston's parting speeches in the House of
Commons, and his expressions in reference to Hungary and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Austria to please the Radicals with whom he is coquetting,
while they do nothing but sing his praises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO IRELAND.</div>

<p>I saw Lord Lansdowne last night, just returned from
Ireland, having had an escape on the railroad, for the train
ran off the rail. He said nothing could surpass the success
of the Queen's visit in every respect; every circumstance
favourable, no drawbacks or mistakes, all persons and parties
pleased, much owing to the tact of Lord Clarendon, and the
care he had bestowed on all the arrangements and details,
which made it all go off so admirably. The Queen herself was
delighted, and appears to have played her part uncommonly
well. Clarendon of course was overjoyed at the complete
success of what was his own plan, and satisfied with the
graciousness and attention of the Court to him. In the
beginning, and while the details were in preparation, he was
considerably disgusted at the petty difficulties that were
made, but he is satisfied now. Lord Lansdowne said the
departure was quite affecting, and he could not see it without
being moved; and he thinks beyond doubt that this visit will
produce permanent good effects in Ireland. All the accounts
represent the material prospects of the country to be better.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, September 15th.</i>&mdash;On Monday, the 3rd, on
returning from Hillingdon, I found a summons from John
Russell to be at Balmoral on Wednesday 5th at half-past
two, for a Council, to order a Prayer for relief against the
cholera. No time was to be lost, so I started by the five
o'clock train, dined at Birmingham, went on by the mail
train to Crewe, where I slept; breakfasted the next morning
at Crewe Hall, which I had never seen, and went on by the
express to Perth, which I reached at half-past twelve. I
started on Wednesday morning at half-past six, and arrived
at Balmoral exactly at half-past two. It is a beautiful road
from Perth to Balmoral, particularly from Blairgowrie to
the Spital of Glenshee, and thence to Braemar. Much as I
dislike Courts and all that appertains to them, I am glad to
have made this expedition, and to have seen the Queen and
Prince in their Highland retreat, where they certainly appear
to great advantage. The place is very pretty, the house very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
small. They live there without any state whatever; they
live not merely like private gentlefolks, but like very small
gentlefolks,<a href="#Footnote_102" id="FNanchor_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
small house, small rooms, small establishment.
There are no soldiers, and the whole guard of the Sovereign
and the whole Royal Family is a single policeman, who
walks about the grounds to keep off impertinent intruders
or improper characters. Their attendants consisted of Lady
Douro and Miss Dawson, Lady and Maid of Honour; George
Anson and Gordon; Birch, the Prince of Wales's tutor; and
Miss Hildyard, the governess of the children. They live with
the greatest simplicity and ease. The Prince shoots every
morning, returns to luncheon, and then they walk and drive.
The Queen is running in and out of the house all day long,
and often goes about alone, walks into the cottages, and sits
down and chats with the old women. I never before was in
society with the Prince, or had any conversation with him.
On Thursday morning John Russell and I were sitting
together after breakfast, when he came in and sat down
with us, and we conversed for about three-quarters of an
hour. I was greatly struck with him. I saw at once (what
I had always heard) that he is very intelligent and highly
cultivated, and moreover that he has a thoughtful mind,
and thinks of subjects worth thinking about. He seemed
very much at his ease, very gay, pleasant, and without the
least stiffness or air of dignity. After luncheon we went to
the Highland gathering at Braemar&mdash;the Queen, the Prince,
four children and two ladies in one pony carriage; John
Russell, Mr. Birch, Miss Hildyard, and I in another; Anson
and Gordon on the box; one groom, no more. The gathering
was at the old Castle of Braemar, and a pretty sight enough.
We returned as we came, and then everybody strolled about
till dinner. We were only nine people, and it was all very
easy and really agreeable, the Queen in very good humour
and talkative; the Prince still more so, and talking very
well; no form, and everybody seemed at their ease. In the
evening we withdrew to the only room there is besides the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
dining-room, which serves for billiards, library (hardly any
books in it), and drawing-room. The Queen and Prince and
her ladies and Gordon soon went back to the dining-room,
where they had a Highland dancing-master, who gave them
lessons in reels. We (John Russell and I) were not admitted
to this exercise, so we played at billiards. In process of
time they came back, when there was a little talk, and soon
after they went to bed. So much for my visit to Balmoral.
I was asked to stay there the first night, but was compelled
to remain there the second, as the Braemar gathering took
all the horses, and it was impossible to get away. The
Prince was very civil about my staying when this was
explained to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BALMORAL.</div>

<p>I had a walk on Wednesday with Aberdeen, who came
over for the Council. He said the Government were going
on very well <i>in all respects but one</i>, but he admitted that it
was impossible to get rid of Palmerston, and therefore Lord
John could do nothing but defend him; that Peel would
not attack him in the House of Commons, as nothing would
induce him to do anything to weaken the present Government,
though he disapproved of Palmerston's conduct as much
as Aberdeen himself. He said that Peel thought of nothing
but the progress and developement of his Free Trade measures;
that the present Government alone could and would
carry them out, and therefore he strenuously supported them,
being perfectly conscious that he had no party, and consequently
no power. This was just what I believed to be the
case in reference to Peel's sentiments and conduct. He
considers his own reputation as a statesman staked on the
success of these measures, and thinks of nothing else. This
is, however, a disagreeable prospect for those of his adherents
who followed his fortunes to the last, and are now left high
and dry. Aberdeen spoke much of the Queen and Prince,
of course with great praise. He said the Prince's views
were generally sound and wise, with one exception, which
was his violent and incorrigible German unionism. He goes
all lengths with Prussia; will not hear of the moderate plan
of a species of federalism based on the Treaty of Vienna
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
and the old relations of Germany; and insists upon a new
German Empire, with the King of Prussia for its head. I
saw by his conversation at dinner that his opinions were just
what Aberdeen represented them to be.</p>

<p>John Russell and I left Balmoral, and travelled together
as far as Perth on Friday morning. We discussed Palmerston,
his policy, his character, and his conduct, fully and
freely. Lord John endeavoured to argue the Spanish and
Sicilian cases, but he really had nothing to say in defence of
Palmerston, or in opposition to my charges and assertions;
and by degrees, as we talked on, he came to admit that Palmerston
was justly chargeable with the faults that I had
imputed to him. He told me, moreover, of a case in which
he had been obliged to interfere not long ago. When the
question of the Piedmontese indemnity was in discussion,
our Government, as well as the French, endeavoured to persuade
that of Austria to reduce the amount they at first
demanded. With this object Palmerston wrote a despatch;
but he thought fit to put into it, that the Austrians were
the more bound to do this, as the war itself was their own
fault, for if they had sent ambassadors to the Congress that
was to have met at Brussels, as they ought to have done, it
would never have taken place. Lord John said he thought
this very useless and inexpedient, and insisted on its being
struck out. Palmerston maintained that it was true. Lord
John said, true or not, there was no use in saying it, and it
was struck out, much to Palmerston's dislike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRUMMOND CASTLE.</div>

<p>In the course of our conversation Lord John told me
something about the famous despatch of July 19,<a href="#Footnote_103" id="FNanchor_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> curiously
illustrative of his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="careless">laisser aller</i> way of doing business. After
acknowledging it was very injudicious, he said, 'I remember
the despatch was brought to me on a Sunday morning, just
as I was going to church. I read it over in a hurry; it
did not strike me at the moment that there was anything
objectionable in it, and I sent it back. If I had not gone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
to church, and had paid more attention to it, it would not
have gone;' and upon this despatch, thus carelessly read
and permitted to go, hinged the quarrels with France and
with Spain, the Montpensier marriage, and not impossibly,
though indirectly, the French Revolution itself.</p>

<p>Lord John and I parted at Perth. He went on to Edinburgh
and I to Drummond Castle, where I stayed two nights.
It is a grand place; the finest on the whole I have seen in
Scotland. The gardens, which are so celebrated, really are
fabulous, and unlike any others I ever saw. From Drummond
Castle I went to Tullyallan for one night; thence to
Drumlanrig for two. This is a magnificent place, the situation
of the Castle unrivalled, and presenting a noble object
in a hundred different views. The gardens are more extensive
and more enjoyable, but not so curious as at Drummond
Castle. I went on Wednesday to Worsley, and on
Thursday returned to town, excessively amused and interested
with my expedition, and more than ever delighted
with Scotland.

<div class="sidenote">THE GORHAM CASE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, January 16th, 1850.</i>&mdash;Since I first began to keep
a journal I do not believe so long an interval has ever elapsed
as between the last time I wrote anything and now. Without
there having been any matter of great importance, there
have been fifty small things I might have recorded at least
as interesting as one half that these books contain; but I
know not why, I have never felt the least inclination, but,
on the contrary, a considerable aversion, to the occupation.
I have over and over again resolved to recommence writing,
and as often have failed from an inexplicable repugnance to
execute my purpose. I am at last induced to take up my
pen to put down what has taken place in the case of Gorham
and the Bishop of Exeter, because this is a matter which
excites great interest, which will not speedily be forgotten,
and on which it is desirable there should be some authentic
account, especially in respect to those parts of the proceedings
which are not publicly known. The details of the case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
itself are to be found in a hundred publications, and I shall
therefore confine myself to what passed behind the curtain.
Jenner<a href="#Footnote_104" id="FNanchor_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
having given judgement in the Court of Arches in
favour of the Bishop, Gorham appealed to the Privy Council.
We first had to consider what steps we should take to form
a competent Court. It was immediately settled that the two
Archbishops and the Bishop of London<a href="#Footnote_105" id="FNanchor_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> should be invited to
attend, and I wrote them letters, setting forth the clause in
the Privy Council Act by which the Queen was authorised to
summon them, telling them they could not vote, but signifying
the desire of the Lord President they would attend to
give their opinions to the Judicial Committee. The two
Archbishops wrote answers that they would come; the
Bishop of London sent no answer, and I found out afterwards
that he would have preferred the attendance of the
prelates being dispensed with. We then considered whom
we should get to form the Court, and after a consultation
with Lord Lansdowne, it was settled that the whole of
the Judicial Committee should be summoned, but with an
intimation that while it had been considered advisable to
send a summons to every member of the Court on account
of the importance of the question, their attendance was
not imperative. It was also deemed very desirable to have
at least one Common Law Judge there. In the Court of
Delegates a Common Law Judge was always indispensable,
and Baron Parke had often pronounced a strong opinion that
one ought always to be present in those Appeals to the
Judicial Committee which formerly went to the Delegates.
We had, however, great difficulty in getting one; neither
Wilde nor Pollock would consent to attend, and Parke had
made an engagement to go into the country. At length,
finding that unless Parke agreed to come we should have no
Common Law Judge, I wrote him a strong and pressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
letter, urging him to attend; and having got the Lord
President to back me up, he agreed to give up his engagement
and assist at the hearing of the case. The Court was
finally composed of Lords Langdale and Campbell, Baron
Parke, Vice-Chancellor Knight Bruce, Dr. Lushington, and
Mr. Pemberton Leigh. Lord Lansdowne came the first day
and opened the proceedings; made a short speech, stating
that Her Majesty had been advised to summon the prelates in
so important a case, and that he himself did not contemplate
attending throughout the hearing, as he did not consider himself
competent to act as a Judge in that Court, though always
ready to render his assistance in arranging their proceedings,
and then having fairly launched them he went away. The
cause was very elaborately and very ably argued by Turner
for Gorham, and Baddeley for the Bishop. The Court was
crammed full almost every day, and the interest very great.
It was conducted with great moderation and decorum on all
sides, with one exception. At the end of his speech Baddeley
very injudiciously and very indecently made a personal
attack on the Archbishop of Canterbury. He charged him
with having given a living to a man holding Gorham's
opinions, and therefore being prejudiced in this case. The
Prelate, with some emotion, but very mildly, explained that
he had given the living to the clergyman in question before
he had published the book in which these opinions were said
to be enunciated, and that he knew nothing about them.
Baddeley made a sort of apology, and Campbell rebuked him
with some severity, but at the same time acknowledged the
ability of his speech, and, with this exception, its moderation
and becoming tone. When the arguments were over, the
Lords remained in discussion for some time. The Prelates
all said they should like to take time to consider their
opinions, and then to give them in writing. It was therefore
agreed that they should meet again on the 15th, when they
would read their written opinions to the Judicial Committee;
and it was also settled that Lord Langdale should draw
up the Report. There was not much discussion, but it was
evident from what passed that the judgement would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
reversed. Yesterday afternoon they assembled again. The
Archbishop of Canterbury began. His paper was excellent.
He showed that opinions, if not identical with, yet very
like, those of Gorham had been held by a host of great
and good Churchmen, and he was strongly of opinion that
the Bishop was not justified in refusing to induct him. The
Archbishop of York followed. He gave the same opinion,
but in a much less able paper. Then came the Bishop of
London. He said he entirely agreed with the two Archbishops,
so far as they had gone; intimated that his first
impression had been the same as theirs, but in looking more
closely into Gorham's doctrine he had arrived at the conclusion
that he had gone considerably beyond what had
ever been held by any of the eminent persons whom the
Archbishop had quoted, and that he had distinctly laid
down positions wholly inconsistent with the efficacy of the
Baptismal Sacrament, and that this he could not get over.
He therefore gave an opinion, though it did not seem to be
a very decided one, against Gorham. The Lords thanked
the Prelates, and begged for copies of their several papers,
and then they proceeded very briefly to state their own
views. Lord Langdale said a very few words against the
judgement of the Court below. Baron Parke said he had
written his opinion, and they begged him to read it. It was
a very good argument, of which, however, he did not read
the whole, and he agreed with Lord Langdale. Campbell
neither made a speech nor read a paper, but took a similar
view. Lushington said he had written out his opinion, but
had not brought his paper with him. He made, however, a
short speech, very good indeed, in which he pronounced a
strong opinion against the Bishop, commenting in severe
terms upon the nature of the examination, and setting forth
the great danger to the peace of the Church which would
result from a judicial declaration on their part that Gorham's
opinions were clearly proved to be heretical. After him
came Knight Bruce, who read a paper of moderate length,
but strongly condemnatory of Gorham, and for affirming the
judgement of the Court below. Pemberton Leigh was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
last. He said he had not been prepared to express any
opinion, having conceived that they were only to meet to
hear those of the Prelates; but he made a very short speech,
in which he gave a very decided opinion for reversing the
judgement; and he showed very clearly that if there were
some answers of Gorham's which appeared to bear out the
Bishop of London's view of the matter, there were others by
which they were neutralised, and in which he gave his unqualified
assent and consent to those doctrines of the Church
which the Bishops alleged that he rejected. Some conversation,
all very amicable, then ensued, and the question was
settled. Lord Langdale undertook to prepare the judgement.
The Bishop of London said he hoped nothing would
be said in it condemnatory of the Bishop of Exeter's doctrine,
at which they all exclaimed that they would take care nothing
of the kind was done; they would steer as clear as possible
of any declaration of opinion as to doctrine, and found their
judgement on this, that it had not been proved to them that
Gorham had put forth any doctrine so clearly and undoubtedly
at variance with the Articles and formularies as to
warrant the Bishop's refusal to induct him. Lushington
said he had the greatest difficulty in making out what
Gorham's doctrine really was, and he was much struck with
the fact that in no part of the Bishop's pleadings did he say
explicitly with what he charged him. They then separated,
no time having been fixed for giving judgement. But for
Knight Bruce it would be unanimous; but he will never give
way, and this will prevent their declaring that they are
unanimous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD ALVANLEY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 23rd.</i>&mdash;If I had not been too lazy to write about
anybody or anything, I should not have suffered the death
of Lord Alvanley to pass without some notice. The world,
however, has no time to think of people who are out of its
sight, and a long illness which had confined him entirely,
and limited his society to a few old friends, caused him
to be forgotten, and his departure out of life to be almost
unobserved. There was a time when it would have been
very different, during those many years when his constant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
spirits and good humour, together with his marvellous wit
and drollery, made him the delight and ornament of society.
I know no description of him so appropriate as the character
of Biron in 'Love's Labour's Lost':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i6">...A merrier man,</span>
<span class="i0">Within the limit of becoming mirth,</span>

</span></p>
</div>

<p>He was originally in the army, came early into the world,
and at once plunged into every sort of dissipation and extravagance.
He was the most distinguished of that set of <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rakes">roués</i>
and spendthrifts who were at the height of the fashion for
some years&mdash;consisting of Brummel, Sir H. Mildmay, Lord
Sidney Osborne, Foley, John Payne, Scrope Davies, and
several others, and when all of them were ruined and dispersed
(most of them never to recover), Alvanley still survived,
invulnerable in his person, from being a Peer, and
with the means of existence in consequence of the provident
arrangement of his uncle, who left him a considerable property
in the hand of trustees, and thus preserved from the
grasp of his creditors. He was naturally of a kind and affectionate
disposition, good-natured, obliging, and inclined to
be generous; but he was to the last degree reckless and profligate
about money; he cared not what debts he incurred,
and he made nothing of violating every sort of pecuniary
engagement or obligation. He left the friends who assisted
him in the lurch without remorse, and such was the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="geniality">bonhomie</i>
of his character, and the irresistible attraction of his society,
that they invariably forgave him, and after exhausting their
indignation in complaints and reproaches, they became more
intimate with him than before. Many a person has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
astonished, after hearing the tale of Alvanley's abominable
dishonesty and deceit, to see the plaintiff and the culprit the
dearest of friends in the world. He was a great example
how true it is that&mdash;</p>

<p>When I recollect his constant treacheries, and the never-failing
placability of his dupes, I always think of the story
of Manon L'Escaut, of whom he appears to me to have been a
male prototype. It would be very difficult to convey any idea
of the sort of agreeableness which was so captivating in him.
He did not often say very witty things; it was not uproarious
mirth, and jokes exciting fits of laughter like Sydney Smith;
he was unlike any of the great luminaries of his own or of
bygone times; but he was delightful. He was so gay, so
natural, so irresistibly comical, he diffused such cheerfulness
around him, he was never ill-natured; if he quizzed anybody
and bantered them, he made them neither angry nor unhappy;
he had an even and constant flow of spirits, and
till his health became impaired you were <i>sure</i> of him in
society. He was vain, but it was a harmless and amusing
vanity, which those who knew him well understood and
laughed at. He had rioted in all the dissipations of play and
wine and women, and for many years (a <i>liaison</i> which began
when neither were very young, and was the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rehash">réchauffé</i> of an
earlier affair, before she was married) he was the notorious
and avowed lover of Lady &mdash;&mdash;. What Burke says with
a sort of mock modesty of himself, was true of Alvanley&mdash;he
had 'read the book of life for a long time, and other books a
little!' For the first years of his life he was too entirely
plunged in dissipation and debauchery to repair in any way
the deficiencies of a neglected education; later, he read a
good deal in a desultory way, and acquired a good store of
miscellaneous information. At one period he addicted himself
to politics, but he never made any figure in the House
of Lords, having no parliamentary experience, no oratorical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
genius, and no foundation of knowledge. But it was during
this period that he signalised his courage in his duel with
young O'Connell. Before that event, for no particular reason
but that he was only known as a voluptuary, no very high
idea was entertained of his personal bravery; but on this
occasion it shone forth with great lustre, for no man ever
exhibited more resolution or indifference to danger. For
the last four years of his life he was afflicted with painful
diseases, and his sufferings were incessant and intense. He
bore them all with a fortitude and a cheerfulness which
never failed him, and which excited universal sympathy and
admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 2nd.</i>&mdash;The Session opened on Thursday,<a href="#Footnote_106" id="FNanchor_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and

so signal and decisive as to leave no uncertainty in
respect to the agricultural questions, or the stability of the
Government. After all the sound and fury which have pervaded
the country, and the formidable attitude they assumed,
they entered on the parliamentary contest in a very feeble
and apparently undecided, if not disunited manner. And
nothing could be more shocking than the contrast between
the rage and fury, the denunciations and determinations of
the Protectionists all over the country for months past, and
the moderate language and abstinences from all specific
demands on the part of the leaders in both Houses. Stanley,
who has never said or written a syllable during the recess,
and kept aloof from all agitation, made a very reasonable
speech, disclaiming any wish to interrupt the experiment,
which he was sure would fail, and only requiring that if it
did fail, we should retrace our steps. This was very different
from Richmond, who was coarse and violent, and
declared he wanted to turn out the Government, and restore
Protection at once. In the other House, Disraeli was very
bad, and there was no possibility of making out what he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
meant or was driving at. Cobden was very good, and had
much the best of him. All this disunion and weakness
ended in good divisions, an exposure of the weakness and
inefficiency of the Tory party, and apparently putting the
Government at their ease and into smooth water.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this apparent prosperity many
people (of whom I am one) are far from easy at the state of
affairs. The Opposition are rabid, and bent on annoying
and damaging the Government in every way they can. The
Radicals are lying in wait to take advantage of their resentment
and turn it to their own purposes. It is impossible not
to feel that the Free Trade 'experiment,' as it is called, is a
fearful and a doubtful one; and even supposing it to succeed
(as I think it will in the long run), there are so many weak
and vulnerable landlords and tenants, that there will be a
great deal of intermediate havoc and distress; and the
farmers have been so terrified and excited by their leaders
and orators, that there is good reason to fear, when they find
Protection cannot be had, that they will become financial
reformers, break through all the old patriarchal ties, and go
to any lengths which they may fancy they can make instrumental
to their relief. The Protectionists have had the folly
to poison and pervert their minds, and to raise a spirit they
will find it difficult either to manage or subdue. In short,
the country is in a greater state of fermentation and uncertainty
than I have ever known it, and its conservative qualities,
and faculty of righting itself, and resisting extreme
dangers, will be put to a severe test.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON AND LORD GREY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 10th.</i>&mdash;The brightness of the Ministerial prospect
was very soon clouded over, and last week their disasters
began. There was first of all the Greek affair, and then
the case of the Ceylon witnesses&mdash;matters affecting Lord
Palmerston and Lord Grey. The Greek case will probably
be settled, thanks to French mediation, but it was a bad
and discreditable affair, and has done more harm to Palmerston
than any of his greater enormities.<a href="#Footnote_107" id="FNanchor_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>  The other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Ministers are extremely annoyed at it, and at the sensation
it has produced. The disgust felt at these bullying and
paltry operations is great and universal, and it will of course
tend to make us still more odious abroad. As far as Palmerston
himself is concerned, he will as usual escape unscathed,
quite ready to plunge into any fresh scrape to-morrow, uncorrected
and unchecked; he bears a charmed life in politics,
he is so popular and so dexterous that he is never at a loss,
nor afraid, nor discomposed. He is supported by his own
party; the Peelites will not attack him for fear of hurting
the Government; and he is the pet of the Radicals, to whom
he pays continual court, giving them sops in the shape of
Liberal speeches, Hungarian sympathies, and claptrap&mdash;unmeaning
verbiage of different sorts.</p>

<p>Very different is the case of Grey. He is as unpopular
as the other is popular. The House of Commons swarms
with his bitter enemies, and he commands very few friends.
Notwithstanding his great and undeniable abilities, he committed
blunders, which proceed from his contempt for the
opinion of others, and the tenacity with which he clings to
his own; and while those who know him are aware that a
man more high-minded, more honourable and conscientious
does not exist, he has contrived to make himself pass for a
Minister whose word cannot be relied on. This last affair
of the Ceylon witnesses is indeed well calculated to confirm
such an impression, and to heap additional odium on his
head. It is wholly without excuse, damaging to him,
damaging to the Government, and will animate and embitter
the personal hostility with which he is pursued to a
degree that will probably bring him to grief in the course
of this Session, and perhaps the whole Cabinet with him.<a href="#Footnote_108" id="FNanchor_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
The Government was only saved from a defeat on Wednesday
morning by the bad tactics of Disraeli, who moved so strong
a resolution that few would support it. Bright then moved
one more moderate, and was only beaten by nine; had the
more moderate one been moved at first, it would have been
carried. These two incidents have been vexatious and injurious,
and were not improved by an angry personal squabble
between Horsman on one side and John Russell and Sir
George Grey on the other, in which, however, the former is
undoubtedly in the wrong.</p>

<p>Lord Stanley has taken up Lord Roden's cause,<a href="#Footnote_109" id="FNanchor_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> and is
going to attack the Irish Government, much to my surprise,
for he told me himself at Newmarket that he thought Roden
quite wrong, and that Clarendon could not help dismissing
him. But what he may have said or thought all goes for
nothing when he can find an opportunity of making an
assault on the Government, or 'giving them a gallop,' as
he told Clanricarde he was going to do, when he gave notice
of his motion. </p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PACIFICO CASE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;There has been a grand discussion
whether Clarendon should come over to meet Stanley and
Roden on Monday next. He was greatly against coming,
and so were several of his friends; but John Russell, George
Grey, and Lord Lansdowne all thought he had better come,
and he acquiesced, though reluctantly, and retaining his
opinion that it was not expedient. Stanley told Granville
yesterday that he was not going to defend Orange processions,
and had only taken up the matter for the purpose of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
preventing personal matters between Clarendon and Roden
being mixed up with the discussion on the Processions Act,
and to have those personal matters settled beforehand; <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="besides">au
reste</i>, that he had at first thought Clarendon had been quite
in the right, but since he had seen all the evidence and read
the papers he had changed his opinion, and thought Roden
and the other Peers had been hardly treated. Clarendon
himself wrote me word he was convinced Stanley only
brought forward this matter to satisfy his Irish adherents,
who had been urging him to do it. It is most probable
that he finds himself in a scrape with his party, who must
be excessively disappointed and disgusted at his very lukewarm
advocacy of Protection in his speech on the first night
of the Session, and indeed at the way he has kept aloof from
all their agitation; and he finds it necessary to do something
to satisfy them in other ways. So he will take every
opportunity he can find of attacking the Government, and
try to excite and assure his party by such field-days as
Dolly's Brae, and by working the Greek question and anything
else he can lay his hands on.</p>

<p>This Greek question is the worst scrape into which
Palmerston has ever got himself and his colleagues. The
disgust at it here is universal with those who think at all
about foreign matters; it is past all doubt that it has produced
the strongest feelings of indignation against this
country all over Europe, and the Ministers themselves are
conscious what a disgraceful figure they cut, and are ashamed
of it. Labouchere came into my room yesterday and let
loose about it without reserve. He said it admitted of no
excuse, and that John Russell, who alone could have prevented
it, was inexcusable for not having done so; that it
ought to have been brought regularly and formally before
the Cabinet, who ought all to have known precisely what it
was Palmerston proposed to do. Papers indeed were sent
round in boxes, and Palmerston defended himself on this
ground, and asked why they did not read them; but (said
Labouchere) how was it possible for men who had large
departments with a vast deal of business of their own, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
read all the papers which were brought round in circulation?
They neither did nor could. It was quite clear from all this
that the Greek affair was not a measure well considered,
discussed, and agreed on by the Cabinet, but done in the
true Palmerstonian style, offhand, partly and casually communicated
to his colleagues, but so managed as to be his
own act, to which they indeed became parties, completely
implicated, but in which they were not really consulted, and
which passed under their eyes without entering into their
serious thoughts. Now that the whole magnitude of the
scrape is revealed to them they are full of resentment and
mortification. Graham told Arbuthnot the other day that
he thought the breaking down of the Government would be
the greatest of evils, and he would do anything to support
them, but that it was impossible for them to go on with two
such men as Grey and Palmerston.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 17th.</i>&mdash;I breakfasted with Senior yesterday, to
meet Macaulay, Hallam, and Van de Weyer, and I had some
talk with the latter about Greece. Of course, he expressed
himself with reserve, but he owned it was a very bad affair,
and could not end either creditably or well. He said he
thought there was a good chance of patching up the quarrel
with Spain, which was in the hands of his King. After the
breakfast I went to Kent House, where I found Clarendon
arrived the night before in very good spirits. He gave me
an outline of his case, and told me several facts, very important
and available, and I am sanguine as to his coming
well out of it, if he can manage his materials adroitly. On
the other hand, the Stanleians and Rodentes give out that
they have a great case, the first on constitutional, and the
last on personal, grounds; but both profess an intention to
be moderate in their mode of pressing it. Lord Grey has
had a success in the Ceylon Committee in the evidence of
Captain Watson, who proved the proclamation attributed to
him to be a forgery; and he threw so much discredit on
Baillie's evidence that Graham told me he thought it would
be fatal to his case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOLLY'S BRAE AFFAIR.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 19th.</i>&mdash;Stanley brought on the Dolly's Brae
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
affair last night in a long, clever, and artful speech, delivered
in his best style. But it was the speech of a clever <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="original jurisdiction">nisi
prius</i> advocate, and consisted principally of an ingenious
dissection of Berwick's report and the evidence, and a bitter
attack upon him. The useless and unmeaning character of
this display was very apparent when he announced his intention
of doing nothing, and asking no opinion of the
House. Clarendon rose after him. He made a very good
case, his points told remarkably well, and, on the whole,
he acquitted himself successfully, and to the satisfaction
of his friends; but, coming after Stanley's practised and
brilliant declamation, his style appeared tame and feeble.
It was easy to see that he was no debater, and that his
parliamentary inexperience diminished his force and efficacy.
For a little while I was in great alarm for him, and thought
he was going to break down; but he recovered, and got
through his speech very well. If he had had more artistic
power, he would have made his excellent materials much
more effective than they were. In such hands as Stanley's
they would have been crushing; they would have been very
powerful if Lord Lansdowne had had them; but as it was, it
was well enough. There was no personality introduced into
the debate; the rival speeches were very civil and complimentary
to each other; and Roden, throughout his dull and
inaudible harangue, called Clarendon his noble friend, to
which Clarendon of course responded in his short second
speech. Before it began Stanley and Clarendon rushed to
each other across the House, and shook hands very cordially,
like a couple of boxers before setting to.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 20th.</i>&mdash;Clarendon called on me yesterday, very
happy at his success the night before. There is a pretty
general opinion that he made out a very good case, and that
Stanley's was a failure. The latter made one or two great
mistakes, and was detected in one very discreditable attempt.
He quoted from an Act of Parliament, reading an extract
from it, but stopping short at that part of the clause which
would have upset his own argument. By a great piece of
good luck, the Chancellor Brady had anticipated the possibility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
of this Act being alluded to, and had sent it over
to Clarendon, pointing out this clause, and Clarendon only
received it two hours before the debate came on.</p>

<p>Clarendon told me he expected the Encumbered Estates
Act would prove the regeneration of Ireland, and that this
measure was entirely done by himself. When he was here
last year he saw Peel, who said he would give up his own
scheme if Clarendon could accomplish something of this
kind. Clarendon spoke to John Russell about it, who said
legal reforms were impossible; the lawyers never would
carry them out. Clarendon replied, 'Only lend me your
Solicitor-General, and I will do it all.' Romilly went over
to Dublin, the Chancellor was cajoled, the Irish Attorney-and
Solicitor-General were frightened into acquiescence, and
Romilly drew the Bill with their concurrence, which was
passed last Session, and is now working with extraordinary
effect. The Lord-Lieutenancy is to be abolished on January 1,
1851, and the Bill to be brought in this Session. Clarendon
will then be Secretary of State for Ireland.</p>

<p>We had some talk about our foreign affairs, especially
Greece, of which he had himself only heard a little. I had
heard that Palmerston had been making some fresh proposal
to the Cabinet, at which they had kicked, and I now learned
what it was. So little disposed is he, notwithstanding all
the feelings and opinions that have been manifested, to
recede, that he proposed that instructions should be sent
to Wyse to insist that the French Minister at Athens
(or agent of the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="good offices">bons offices</i>, whoever he may be) should be
obliged to require of the Greek Government an immediate
compliance with the whole of our demands. This the
Cabinet refused to do, but Lord Lansdowne owned to
Clarendon that he was by no means sure that they were
apprised of all the instructions that had been sent, or
that this requisition might not have gone out, though the
Cabinet had refused its consent to it. Clarendon told Lord
Lansdowne that he hoped he was not insensible to the state
of public opinion on this matter, and he said he was fully
aware of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR ROBERT PEEL ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 22nd.</i>&mdash;On Wednesday, as I was crossing the
Park, I fell in with Sir Robert Peel, and turned back
with him to Charles Wood's, where he was going, after
which we went towards his home, and walked up and down
behind Whitehall for half an hour or more, talking of all
sorts of things. He began about the Roden affair, on which
he thought there was no case against Clarendon, but that
he might have made more clearly known to Lord Roden his
dislike to the procession, and considering the friendly terms
they had been on, that there was some want of courtesy
in making no communication to him before the notice of
dismissal, particularly after Roden had offered to resign if it
would be of any use to him that he should do so. I explained
all these matters to him, and showed him that Clarendon
had said and done all he could, and that no blame attached
to him. He said he had known nothing of the matter but
what Jocelyn had told him.</p>

<p>He then spoke of foreign affairs, and did not spare
Palmerston. He reviewed the general course of our proceedings,
and especially the Greek affair, which he thought
very bad; but what was still worse, was our having sent
our fleet into the Dardanelles, having no right to do so, and
then asserting we were driven there by stress of weather,
which was a pretence and a falsehood. This was very
disgraceful, and the use to which our fleet had been put
very shameful. That Palmerston had met with nothing
but failures from Lisbon, where he first sent the fleet, and
where his enemy Cabral had been ever since in power down
to the present occasion. Brunnow had spoken to him the
other day, and talked very good sense. He said the Emperor
of Russia would not quarrel on this matter, not having done
so on our fleet going to the Dardanelles; he would not on
account of two uninhabited islets, but he would feel it. He
alluded to the Emperor's sarcastic remark on the story of
our fleet being compelled to take shelter in the Dardanelles;
that 'he had always understood our fleets were most ably
and powerfully manned, their tactics very superior, and
that Sir William Parker was a very skilful officer; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
that <i>his</i> fleet, though lying in that sea for many months,
had never found itself under any such necessity.' Brunnow
said it was a great pity that somebody could not represent
to Palmerston the impolicy of the course he had been pursuing
all over Europe; that it was evident his real motive
and intention in the Greek affair had been to bring about
a revolution there, and that he had expected, when his fleet
appeared, there would be a rising against Otho, who would
be expelled; that when Europe was only just emerging from
a state of general revolution, and order was only lately
restored, what folly it was to provoke a fresh revolution,
and to reopen an important question, the settlement of
which might lead to the greatest difficulties! Brunnow
always defends Palmerston, and affects to make light of all
the <i>accidents</i> that arise, but he speaks his real sentiments to
Peel and Aberdeen. Peel said he had seen a letter from
an officer in Parker's fleet, representing that the Admiral
was exceedingly disgusted at the business put into his
hands. We occupied so much time in discussing Ireland
and Greece, that there was none to go into other matters,
though I should have liked to hear his opinion of the state
and prospects of the country.</p>

<p>Last night I met Clarendon at dinner at Bath House,
when I told him what had passed between Peel and me. He
told me also that Roden had behaved shabbily to him, when
he quoted in the House of Lords the letter he had written,
offering to resign the magistracy, but concealing the latter
part of the same letter in which he said that he hoped he
would not accept it if he thought it would be any triumph
to the Catholics, for they had now got them down, and they
should be able to keep them down. This, Clarendon said,
he felt tempted to read himself, as Roden chose to read the
first part, but he abstained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCE ALBERT ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</div>

<p>He then gave me an account of what had passed between
the Queen and Prince and himself. He dined at the Palace
on Tuesday. I told him they were sure to talk to him on
foreign affairs, but he said he should avoid it. However,
he could not avoid it. The moment he came into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
drawing-room after dinner the Queen exploded, and went
with the utmost vehemence and bitterness into the whole of
Palmerston's conduct, all the effects produced all over the
world, and all her own feelings and sentiments about it.
He could only listen and profess his own almost entire ignorance
of the details. After she had done Prince Albert began,
but not finding time and opportunity to say all he wished,
he asked him to call on him the next day. He went and had
a conversation of two hours and a half, in the course of which
he went into every detail, and poured forth without stint or
reserve all the pent-up indignation, resentment, and bitterness
with which the Queen and himself have been boiling
for a long time past. He commented on Palmerston's policy
and conduct much in the same terms in which the 'Times'
does, and as I and others do. But what he enlarged upon
with the strongest feeling was the humiliating position in
which the Queen was placed in the eyes of the whole world.
The remonstrances and complaints, the sentiments and resentments
of other Sovereigns&mdash;of the King of Naples, and
of the Emperor of Russia, for instance&mdash;directly affected her
dignity as the Sovereign and Representative of this Nation;
and the consciousness that these Sovereigns and all the
world knew that she utterly disapproved of all that was done
in her name, but that she was powerless to prevent it, was
inconceivably mortifying and degrading. Prince Albert said
he knew well enough the Constitutional position of the
Sovereign of this country, and that it was the policy and
measures which the nation desired and approved which the
Government must carry out; but that the nation disapproved
of Palmerston's proceedings, and so did his own colleagues,
Lord Lansdowne particularly; yet by their weak connivance
he was allowed to set at defiance the Sovereign, the
Government, and public opinion, while the Queen could get
neither redress nor support from John Russell, and was
forced to submit to such degradation. He then mentioned
various instances in which the Queen's remonstrances and
suggestions had been disregarded. Minutes submitted to
her in one form and changed by Palmerston into other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
forms; the refusal of Austria to send any Ambassador here,
because he could not transact business with her Secretary of
State. Clarendon asked him if he had ever endeavoured
to influence Palmerston himself, and remonstrated with him
on those matters which had justly excited the strong feelings
of the Queen and himself. He said that he had done
so repeatedly, and for a long time; that he always found him
easy, good-humoured, very pleasant to talk to, but that it
was utterly impossible to turn him from his purposes, or to
place the least reliance on anything he said or engaged to
do, and that at length the conviction which had been forced
upon him of the uselessness of speaking to him had caused
him entirely to leave it off, and for above a year past neither
the Queen nor he had ever said one word to him; that it
was in vain they had appealed to John Russell. He supposed
it was the etiquette for Cabinet Ministers never to
admit there was anything censurable in the conduct of each
other, for though he was certain many things were done of
which John Russell could not approve, and for which he was
unable to make any defence, he never would admit that
what had been done had been wrong; that the consequence
of this had been to impair considerably the relations of confidence
and openness which ought to exist between the Queen
and her Prime Minister, and to place her in an unsatisfactory
position <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> of him. After dilating at great length on
this topic, he said something from which Clarendon inferred
that his object was to make <i>him</i> a channel of communication
with John Russell, and thus to make their sentiments
known to him more clearly and unreservedly than they could
do themselves, and he means to tell Lord John all that
passed. He said the Prince talked very sensibly and very
calmly, very strong, but without excitement of manner. I
shall be curious to hear what Lord John says to it all;
but though it can hardly fail somewhat to disturb his mind,
I don't believe it will make the least alteration in his conduct,
or change an iota of the 'unconquerable will and study
of revenge' of Palmerston, or prevent his doing just what
he pleases in spite of all the world. Peel told me he understood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
we were sending to Leghorn to make demands of
some sort there, which he concluded was done to annoy
Austria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON THE POOR LAWS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 23rd.</i>&mdash;The division in the House of Commons
on Thursday night was hailed with vociferous cheers by the
Protectionists, who considered it a great victory and the
harbinger of future success.<a href="#Footnote_110" id="FNanchor_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
Everybody was taken by surprise,
for though it was known that the Opposition would
muster strong, nobody imagined there would be so small a
majority as twenty, the Government expected about forty.
Graham spoke very well, and so did Gladstone <i>in reply to
him</i>, the part the latter took exciting a considerable sensation.
Disraeli was good, both in his opening speech and
reply. Graham told me he was much improved, and his
taste and tone far better than formerly. Peel was long and
heavy, talked of himself too much, and made one of those
defences of his former conduct which he might as well let
alone, for they are superfluous with one half of the House
and country, and useless with the other. He had much
better, as Disraeli told him, do like Cosmo de Medici, and
leave his character to posterity; he unwisely enough noticed
a very warm and unjust attack which Henry Bentinck had
made upon him at some public meeting. Henry Bentinck,
like a true member of his family and own brother to George,
instead of recanting or apologising, insinuated his disbelief
in what Peel said, and was as offensive as the clamour
and displeasure of the House and his own inarticulateness
allowed him to be. In the afternoon yesterday Graham
called on me to speak about the Australian Bill which was
to have come on next Monday, and on which he said Government
would infallibly be beaten, which following up
the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="almost">quasi</i> defeat of Thursday would be very awkward. I
suggested, after talking the matter over, that he and Peel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
might give them some help, which he said they would do,
but must know what Government thereupon meant to do.
I undertook to find out, but in the meantime John Russell
put off the Bill.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 28th.</i>&mdash;Before Clarendon left town he saw John
Russell, and told him all that had passed between him and
the Prince, and that he was quite certain it had been said to
him for the express purpose of its being repeated to Lord
John. He also told him that it was fit he should understand
the strong and unusual feeling that existed on this
subject, assuring him that he had not met with one single
individual of any party or condition who did not regard it
with disgust and displeasure. He then adjured him, whatever
else he might do, to cultivate better <i>personal</i> feelings, and
more confidential relations with the Queen and Prince, to be
more open with them, and to enter into their feelings, and
this Lord John, who seems to have taken what he said in
very good part, promised he would not fail to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRILLON'S CLUB.</div>

<p>Clarendon had also long conversations with Peel and
Graham, who were both very complimentary and satisfactory
about his case in the House of Lords, and Peel talked to
him a great deal about affairs, both English and Irish. He
was as confident as ever in the impossibility of the restoration
of Protection, and the disastrous, and in the end
abortive, effects of any attempt to do so by a Stanley and
Disraeli Government, if by any possibility they could force
themselves into office. He is evidently much disgusted with
Gladstone and Goulburn, who have given indubitable signs
of forsaking him, and advancing towards the Protectionists,
and Graham said Stanley would now be able to offer the
Queen a list, which would not be an insult. But Gladstone,
though he has twice voted with the Opposition, loudly
declares that he has not changed an iota of his Free Trade
opinions, and has no thoughts of joining the other party,
though they think they can have him whenever they may
vouchsafe to take him. There is a considerably prevailing
opinion of the diminished vigour as well as of the diminished
influence of Peel. His speech the other night was laboured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
and heavy, and not judicious. Then the House was much
struck by the unusual spectacle of Peel and Graham both
rising to speak together, and both persisting to await the
Speaker's call instead of Graham's giving way to Peel, as
he would have done formerly. It was probably the first
time Peel ever rose in the House of Commons to speak, and
had to give way to another speaker. The House called for
the one as much as for the other, and Graham made incomparably
the best speech of the two. Ever since their large
minority, the Protectionists have been in a very rampant
and excited state, overflowing with pugnacity and confidence;
but they made a great mistake in opposing very furiously
and factiously the Irish Voters Bill, and the Government
think that night was exceedingly serviceable to them, by
rallying back a great many of the Irish Members, who were
out of humour, and disposed to go against them in the
matter of protection and relief.</p>

<p>I was last night elected at Grillon's Club, much to my
surprise, for I did not know I was a candidate.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;I dined on Wednesday at Grillon's, and was
received with vast civility and cordiality. A large party,
much larger than usual&mdash;amongst them Harrowby, Granville,
Graham, Sir Thomas Fremantle, Rutherford, Pusey,
Sir Thomas Acland, &amp;c. Sat next to Graham, and had much
talk on affairs. I told him that Labouchere had said to
me a day or two before that John Russell was uneasy about
the House of Commons, and expected that he should be
beaten on more than one item in the financial accounts; that
people told him he must expect to be beaten; but he replied
that repeated defeats on such details materially impaired
his influence and authority in the House, and made it difficult
to carry on the business. Graham said this was very
true, and that he probably would be beaten. He thought
the position of the Government unsatisfactory and precarious;
they had got into some scrapes about both Army
and Naval estimates, unnecessarily and injudiciously. Then
there were the questions of the African squadron and the
Greek business behind. Stanley is very bitter and active, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
eager to fight. He thinks Gladstone, Goulburn, and Aberdeen
would all join Stanley in taking office. I asked him
how it was possible. He said the Protectionists would make
some concessions, and for various reasons and on different
pretexts they would be easily satisfied. He congratulated
himself on his foresight in refusing to take office. This
Greek question was just one of those cases in which he
must have refused to obey the orders of the Foreign Office,
very different now from Lord Grey's time. Then when
he was First Lord of the Admiralty, he used to be every
day at the Foreign Office, and Lord Grey was paramount,
allowing nothing to be done without his full knowledge
and assent, and constantly altering Palmerston's despatches
as a tutor might a boy's exercise. He talked a good deal
about the abolition of the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, of
which he approves, but said the arrangement of the details,
especially about the Chancellor, would be very difficult.
Arbuthnot told me the other day that the Protectionists
are doing all they can to disgust the Yeomanry with the
service, and to induce them to resign, not without success.
This is their patriotism.</p>

<p>I met Brunnow a few days ago coming from Palmerston,
where he had been (though he did not say so) to present the
Emperor's indignant note. He was laughing as he always
does when he speaks of Palmerston; said of this affair,
'<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="It was stupidity; that he could not make Palmerston see the humiliation of the case">que c'était une bêtise; qu'il ne pouvait pas faire comprendre
à Palmerston l'humiliation de l'affaire</span>.' So far from
acknowledging this, or evincing the least sign of regret or
shame, when Hume asked him a question in the House the
other night, he replied with the utmost effrontery, and with
rather more than his usual insolence and audacity. As on
every occasion, the House laughed and nobody said a word.
All that relates to him, his character, conduct, and career,
will hereafter form one of the most curious passages in history
and the most astounding and unaccountable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GORHAM JUDGEMENT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 9th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday judgement was given in Gorham's
case at the Council Office. The crowd was enormous,
the crush and squeeze awful. I accommodated my friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
with seats in court, and there were Wiseman and Bunsen
sitting cheek by jowl, probably the antipodes of theological
opinions. The Lords met an hour before. They made some
alterations in the judgement, and some judicious omissions.
The Bishop of London, after much vacillation, half assenting
and half dissenting, being on and off, by turns against
Gorham and against the Bishop, disagreeing with everybody
and everything, finally sent his determination through Lushington,
and announcing (as was said in the judgement) that
he could not concur. He did not, however, concur in the
statement of Gorham's doctrine as gathered by the Lords,
a difference of construction which shows how impossible it
would have been to condemn Gorham on the score of heterodox,
if not heretical, opinions, when a number of very able
men, laymen and clergymen, after careful examination,
could not agree what his opinions really were. Knight
Bruce dissented altogether, wrote to Lord Langdale to that
effect, and declined coming. The Archbishop agreed in both
judgement and reasons. There was a preliminary discussion
about costs. Langdale, Campbell, and Lushington were
for giving Gorham costs in the Court below; Pemberton
Leigh was against it; and the three eventually yielded to
the one, and it was agreed to say nothing about costs.
Langdale read the judgement well, and the people who heard
it (at least those I talked to) thought it able and judicious;
but of course all the highflyers and Puseyites will be angry
and provoked, and talk of schisms and secessions, which
will be, I am firmly convinced, <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="thunderbolts">bruta fulmina</i>.</p>

<p>Reeve received yesterday afternoon from Paris the
Russian Note&mdash;not the Note itself, but the whole substance
of it, textual evidently, and copied from the note.<a href="#Footnote_111" id="FNanchor_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 19th.</i>&mdash;Last Friday Aberdeen and Stanley had
determined to bring on the Greek affair in the House of
Lords, and Stanley gave notice to Lord Lansdowne he would
ask for information.  Lord Lansdowne, however, before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Stanley rose, got up and begged he would not discuss a
question which was in course of negotiation, and Stanley
was obliged to acquiesce. They were both of them provoked
and disappointed, but there was no help for it. Stanley
then contented himself with asking for the date of the orders
to Parker to stop coercive measures, and it turned out that
Palmerston had delayed sending them for a week upon
miserable pretexts. Lord Lansdowne, as usual, attempted
some lame excuses, and there the matter ended.</p>

<p>To-night comes on the question of the African squadron,
on which the Government have acted a very unwise part.<a href="#Footnote_112" id="FNanchor_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
They have determined (of course in obedience to Palmerston's
will and pleasure) not only to make it a Government question,
but to stake their existence on it; and they have been moving
heaven and earth to obtain support and avert the defeat
with which they were threatened. Their representations
and appeals will probably succeed, but I have already seen
several people who are excessively disgusted at being compelled
to vote against their clear and strong convictions, and
support what they think wrong and foolish in order to
bolster up the Government and carry them through the
difficulty in which they have been involved by their own
perverseness and obstinacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN THREATENS TO RESIGN.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 20th.</i>&mdash;John Russell convoked a meeting in
Downing Street yesterday, and made them a speech which
gave equal offence in manner and in matter. He told them
if he was beaten on Hutt's motion he should resign. Palmerston
made another speech, and announced the same
intention. The people came away furious and indignant,
and several came into my room complaining of the hardship
of being compelled to vote against their conscientious
opinions on such a question, and on the unjustifiable conduct
of the Government in threatening to resign at it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
It seems to me that John Russell is demented at taking
this violent course in reference to so unpopular a question,
and one so entirely fallen into disrepute. He has given
deep offence and prepared great difficulties for himself hereafter.
Baring Wall told me he sent Labouchere to him the
night before to remonstrate, but he made no impression,
and his reply was too ridiculous; that he could not abandon
the course pursued by <i>Mr. Fox</i> and all the great men of the
time, who had striven to put down slavery. He succeeded
in cajoling or frightening people into submission, and after
a debate in which few people spoke, and Palmerston not at
all, leaving it all to Lord John, Hutt's motion was rejected
by a majority of seventy. A great many were absent, not
expecting a division, most of whom would have voted with
Hutt. I never saw anything like the surprise of some
people and the indignation of others at the course which
John Russell took.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 23rd.</i>&mdash;More than a month without a single line.
The Government are supposed to have been going on badly,
having been left in minorities on several occasions, but it is
of no real consequence. The most serious affair was the
Stamp Bill, but it has been partly compromised and partly
patched up, and Charles Wood does not seem to care.<a href="#Footnote_113" id="FNanchor_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> I
saw him the other day, when he said that he thought they
should not be placed in any more difficulties, for some were
ashamed and some were sorry for having deserted the Government
already. They have made up their minds not to
stand repetitions of this fast and loose treatment on the part
of their friends and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="so-called">soi-disant</i> supporters. Wood is uneasy
about the continued low price of corn, and owned to me
that it has continued much longer and had fallen lower than
he had ever contemplated or at all liked. All the accounts
represent that the farmers are behaving well, paying their
rents, and employing the people; but there is a strong feeling
of dissatisfaction and disaffection amongst them.</p>

<p>The Greek affair has dragged on, and wears rather a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
sinister appearance. Drouyn de Lhuys<a href="#Footnote_114" id="FNanchor_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> fell in with Reeve
on Sunday, took him into his house, and opened to him
largely and bitterly on the subject. Yesterday Reeve dined
with him, when he again renewed the discussion&mdash;two remarkable
conversations. He complained in strong terms of
Palmerston's conduct, said that France had exerted herself
with great sincerity to arrange the affair, but had been met
in no corresponding spirit here. He intimated that his
Government would publish to the whole world what had
taken place, and that the matter was assuming a very
grave character towards both Russia and France. Instructions
had, indeed, gone out to Athens, agreed upon between
Palmerston and himself, but he seemed to regard it as very
doubtful whether they would arrive in time&mdash;that is, before
Gros had returned home and Parker resumed hostilities.
He repeated what Van de Weyer had said of the 'universal
execration' in which we were held, and that no country
could excite such a feeling with impunity. It is pretty clear
that if this matter is not now settled there will be an
explosion on the subject at Paris, and some very disagreeable
passages between us and both France and Russia. My own
conviction has all along been that Palmerston never intended
anything but to hoodwink his colleagues, bamboozle the
French, and gain time. By accepting the French mediation
he prevented all discussion in Parliament; and as he took
care to furnish no instructions to Wyse such as might enable
him and Gros to come to terms, the affair could not fail to
drag on, and every day that it did so was fraught with
disastrous consequences to the Greeks. This was what he
wanted; not to back out of it as decently as he could have
done, not to defer to the wishes, opinions, and good offices
of France, but by obstinacy and deceit to gain all his ends&mdash;to
terrify and bully Greece into complete surrender, baffle
Russia, and make France ridiculous. Drouyn de Lhuys told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
Reeve that he and Brunnow were in constant communication
and acting in concert, the latter as usual doing all in his
power to pacify the Emperor at Petersburg, and to get
Palmerston to be reasonable here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CHIEF JUSTICE CAMPBELL.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>April 28th.</i>&mdash;Charles Wood has got into a scrape with
his Stamps Bill, not being able to frame his measure so as
to work satisfactorily. Financial blunders are always injurious,
and affect the credit and authority of a Chancellor
of the Exchequer; but it does not really signify, for the
Government cannot be shaken. John Russell made a slashing
attack in reply on Disraeli on Friday, well enough
done, with spirit and effect.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Campbell gave judgement in the Court
of Queen's Bench in the Gorham case, on the rule moved for
by Sir Fitzroy Kelly. The rule was refused unanimously.
Campbell's judgement was very good, and much admired;
he is doing exceedingly well in his Court.<a href="#Footnote_115" id="FNanchor_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Martin told me
he never heard anything better than the way in which he
disposed of a variety of cases, motions for rules mostly,
which were before him on Monday last. Baron Parke, too,
who did not smile on the appointment, said he was doing
very well. He is not popular, and he is wanting in taste
and refinement, but he is an able lawyer; and already he
appears to great advantage in contrast with the dignified
incompetence of Denman, who was an honourable, high-minded
gentleman, but no lawyer, and one of the feeblest
Chief Justices who ever presided over the Court of Queen's
Bench.</p>

<p>We may at last expect the Greek question to be settled,
I suppose. The decision and alacrity of Palmerston last
Saturday week form a curious contrast with his dilatory
motions a few weeks ago. Then he could not manage to
frame an instruction and despatch it in less than a week or
more; but when matters were getting serious, and he found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
that he must finish the affair, he was quick enough. On
Saturday morning he received the despatches announcing
the difficulties at Athens. He sent for Drouyn de Lhuys,
concerted with him what was to be done, wrote his instructions,
laid them before the Cabinet, got all the forms through,
and sent them off the same evening. The plain meaning of
all this is that in the first instance his object was delay, and
in the second his object was expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLICY OF THE ORLEANS FAMILY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 14th.</i>&mdash;I have written nothing here for many weeks,
but no great loss, for I have not had much to say, if anything.
I am tempted to resume my pen to record rather a
curious event. I have heard this morning of a mission
from Paris to Louis Philippe, and the result of it. The
leaders of the Conservative party there, all except Thiers, have
come to a resolution that the only chance of restoring the
Monarchy is by a reconciliation of the elder and the Orleans
branches, by the recognition of Henri V., and by persuading
Louis Philippe and his family to accept this solution of the
dynastic question. They have accordingly sent over M.
Malac to Claremont to communicate their sentiments to the
King. He was authorised to tell him that the Legitimists
were willing to acknowledge his title and his reign, and
even the benefits that France had derived from his government.
The King entered into the subject with great frankness,
treating with indifference the offers which were personal
to himself, saying he had no need of any recognition
of his reign, of which history would bear sufficient record.
He, however, acquiesced in the views of the party who sent
M. Malac, and declared himself ready to agree to their terms,
but he said that the women of his family would be the most
strenuous opponents of such a compromise. He assembled
a sort of <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="family council">conseil de famille</i>, consisting of the Queen and
the Princes (not the Duchess of Orleans), and laid before
them the proposal that had been made to him. The
Queen declared against it, the Princes were all for it, and
finally the Queen said she would defer to the opinion of the
King. He then proposed to the Ambassador to go and talk
to the Duchess of Orleans, from whom the greatest obstacles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
were to be expected. He declined to speak to her on the
subject, but said he would go and see her, which he did. She
received him, talked of all other subjects, but not a word
about the succession. On repeating to His Majesty what had
passed, he said he would send for her and talk to her, and
after having done so, he desired M. Malac to return and she
would enter on the affair. He went to her again and spoke
to her with great frankness, representing that the Orleans
party was by far the weakest in France, and that her religion
would always make the people more or less, and the
clergy entirely, hostile to her. She was much startled and
discomposed at hearing language to which she seemed not
to have been accustomed; but though she did not avow it
she was not unmoved by his representations. He described
various other meetings and conversations which had occurred
in which the Queen of the Belgians took part (strongly
adverse to the proposal), and finally he departed, without
indeed any formal acceptance of the overtures, but carrying
back such expressions of opinion and disposition on the part
of the family as amounted to a virtual acceptance, and leave
no doubt that the bargain will be concluded. It is not intended
to draw up any compact, nor to take any immediate
steps in consequence. They have no intention of waging
war with the Republic, and only contemplate waiting for the
course of events in the hope that the evils of the country will
eventually drive the masses to seek a remedy for them in
the restoration of the Monarchy, and for this contingency to
be prepared by merging the differences of the two branches
and uniting the strength of both to re-establish the principle.
It was Reeve who told me all this, having had it from M.
Malac himself. He also brought over a letter from Guizot
to Reeve in which Guizot alluded rather mysteriously to
another combination that was possible, and that would be
auxiliary to this scheme. This is a transaction with the
President and Changarnier. Both of the latter are aware
that Louis Napoleon has no chance of perpetuating his own
power either as President or Emperor.<a href="#Footnote_116" id="FNanchor_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> He is overwhelmed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
with debts which he cannot pay, and the whole of his private
fortune is sunk. In no case, therefore, could he retire
to any other country, and he may naturally be willing to
make terms for himself which, in the event of the Monarchy
being restored, would place him in a position of ease
and comfort. Besides his own political nullity, his family
<i>entourage</i> presents an inseparable bar to the revival of the
Empire in his person. He is, indeed, himself by far the best
of his family, being well-meaning and a gentleman; but all
the rest are only a worthless set of <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rabble">canaille</i>, altogether destitute
of merit, and without a title to public consideration and
respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECALL OF THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;This has been a day of agitation. On
Wednesday night all London was excited by the announcement
at Devonshire House (where there was a great rout)
that Drouyn de Lhuys had been recalled and was gone to
Paris, and that neither Brunnow nor Cetto had been present
at Palmerston's birthday dinner. Everybody was talking
yesterday in the two Houses of these things and of the cause
of them, which of course had to do with Greece. Questions
were put to Lord Lansdowne and to Palmerston, when both
of them said that the French Government had desired the
presence of Drouyn de Lhuys at Paris in order to explain
matters, and they both said what was tantamount to a denial
of his having been recalled. At the very moment that they
were making these statements in Parliament, the French
Minister for Foreign Affairs was reading in the tribune of
the National Assembly the formal letter of recall which had
been sent to their Ambassador, which he was instructed to
communicate, and which he read to Palmerston on the preceding
day, and he was at the same time explaining that the
Ambassador had been recalled on account of the manner
in which the English Government had behaved to that of
France, which rendered it incompatible with the dignity of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
the Republic to leave any longer an Ambassador in London.
The report of what had passed appeared in all the papers
this morning, and Brougham again addressed an interpellation
to Lord Lansdowne on the subject, while a Member did
the same to John Russell in the House of Commons, Palmerston
not having chosen to be present. Both made what
must be called shuffling, prevaricating answers, endeavouring
by some clumsy and sophistical pretences to make out
that the letter of recall was not a letter of recall. All
this is very pitiable. After a series of blunders and a long
course of impolitic and unjustifiable acts, Palmerston has
contrived to involve us in a <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="almost">quasi</i> quarrel with France,
and to break up in the most wanton manner, and for
the most ridiculous object, the good understanding which
existed between the two countries. His colleagues, as
usual, find themselves deeply plunged in the scrape into
which they have permitted him to drag them, and obliged,
as a hundred times heretofore, to make common cause
with him, and to swallow all the dirt which he crams
down their throats. While I am writing this they have
brought me the newspaper with the report of what passed
in Parliament, and Lord Lansdowne's and John Russell's
replies, and it really is melancholy to see two such men
reduced to such discreditable shifts, trying to evade giving
direct answers to plain questions, attempting to mislead
without doing so, and only exposing themselves. I see
already that the friends and adherents of Government are
sadly perplexed and annoyed. Lord Eddisbury, who sat
next Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords and prompted
him, told Granville 'he thought Palmerston could not have
told his colleagues everything that had passed.' As to those
colleagues, they deserve every mortification that can befall
them, and are entitled to no pity. They have gone on submitting
to all Palmerston's insolence and vagaries with full
knowledge of having been repeatedly deceived by him, and
not one of them has had spirit enough to cast off this disgraceful
yoke. Instead of forcing him to show some regard
to truth, he has broken them in to back his falsehoods, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
one of the worst consequences that has been produced by his
unfortunate administration is that the confidence and implicit
reliance which ought to be placed on all that a Minister
says in Parliament, can no longer be felt.</p>

<p>This is the greatest scrape into which Palmerston has
ever got, and it will be curious enough too how he gets out
of it. Our Government stands charged by that of France
with breach of faith and violation of compact. We shall
see whether he denies the facts. If he makes one statement,
and Drouyn de Lhuys another, there can be no doubt
which will be best entitled to credit. The latter had no
motive to deceive his own Government, or to do anything
but report faithfully what passed between Palmerston and
himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REMONSTRANCE OF RUSSIA.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 19th.</i>&mdash;There is the devil to pay about this Greek
affair, and at last there seems a tolerable chance of Palmerston
coming to grief: '<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="As the pitcher goes to the water">Tant va la cruche à l'eau</i>,' &amp;c.
Yesterday morning the Duke of Bedford came here and gave
me an account of the state of affairs. It seems Brunnow
had written a long letter to John Russell, couched in very
temperate terms, but setting forth all his complaints of Palmerston's
behaviour, and especially of the language of that
part of the press which was avowedly under his control and
direction, in reference to Russia, and he asked Lord John
to call upon him, he being confined with a cold. Lord John
sent this letter to Palmerston, accompanied with one from
himself, in which he said that he (Palmerston) well knew
how much he disliked such articles and such use of the
press, and a good deal more indicative of displeasure. Palmerston
wrote an answer defending himself, and the very
same evening there appeared in the 'Globe' another article
not less offensive than the preceding ones, greatly to the
indignation of Lord John. He called on Brunnow, who repeated
what he had before said in his letter, and announced
that he must go away, for he would not stay here to be on
bad terms with Palmerston, and it was impossible for him
to remain on good terms. Meanwhile, Lord John had seen
Drouyn de Lhuys before his departure, and from him he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
learnt what (according to his version) had passed between himself
and Palmerston, that is, about the pledge which Drouyn
de Lhuys affirmed Palmerston had given him that hostilities
should not be renewed. The statement of Drouyn de Lhuys
did not correspond with the accounts which Palmerston had
given his colleagues of what had passed, and Lord John at
once saw that there was no avoiding the unpleasant dilemma
of the two Governments being at issue on a matter of fact
which involved the good faith of ours. All this, together
with what had already passed, had raised Lord John's resentment
and disgust to a high pitch, and the Duke said
that Lord John had at last resolved not to stand it any
longer, although (he added) he could not feel complete confidence
in his firmness and resolution after all he had seen
on various occasions.</p>

<p>Lord John said that the first thing to be done was to
settle this matter as they best might; that they must support
Palmerston's assertions, to which they were bound to
give credit; but that when this business was concluded, in
about a month perhaps, he would bring matters to a crisis,
that is, announce to Palmerston that he could not go on
in the Foreign Office. Lord John is at present very angry,
and therefore very stout, but I never can feel sure of him.
He is to see the Queen on Tuesday, who will of course be
boiling over with indignation, and if she finds Lord John at
last disposed to take her views of the matter, the affair may
possibly be settled between them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile no words can describe the universal feeling of
reprobation, and almost of shame, with which the replies of
Lord Lansdowne and Lord John were heard on Friday night.
The morning arrivals from France had clearly shown that
Lord Lansdowne in one House, and John Russell in the
other, had tried to deceive and mislead by what they had
said on Thursday. On Friday Palmerston did not make his
appearance; but the figures which Lord Lansdowne cut in
the Lords and Lord John in the Commons were most deplorable
and humiliating; such shuffling, special pleading,
and paltry evasions were never before heard from public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
men of their eminence and character; and of all that has
occurred this discreditable exposure appears to many friends
of the Government to be the most painful part. It appears
inconceivable that any men should make statements the
falsehood of which was shown in less than forty-eight
hours; but the explanation is this. In the first place, Palmerston
gave to his colleagues an imperfect and unfaithful
account of Drouyn de Lhuys's communication to him. They
were themselves not aware of the whole truth; but besides
this Palmerston gave them to understand that Drouyn de
Lhuys had carried with him such explanations, verbal and
documentary, as would he hoped satisfy his Government, and
consequently that the letter of recall might probably be cancelled,
and the affair arranged. Hoping therefore for this
result, they ventured to deny the recall altogether, but were
completely confounded and exposed by the revelations of
Lahitte<a href="#Footnote_117" id="FNanchor_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
in the tribune the very same day; and then they
had nothing for it but to try and shuffle out of it in the way
they tried but miserably failed to do. It would have been
far better to have spoken the plain truth, or to have declined
to answer till the next day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREEK DISPUTE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 22nd.</i>&mdash;I have read the long series of despatches
published by the French Government, and the result in my
mind is that they do not make out a case of breach of faith
against our Government, supposing Palmerston's instructions
to Wyse to have been in conformity with what was agreed
upon between the two Governments here. This (the most
essential) part of the case lies in a narrow compass. It was
all along perfectly understood that if Gros threw up his
mission, being unable to induce the Greek Government to
consent to equitable terms, our Minister was at liberty to
recommence the coercive measures without any further reference
to his Government; but if the negotiation came to a
standstill in consequence of Gros and Wyse not being able
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
to agree, then the difference between them was to be referred
for the decision of the two Governments upon it, and in this
case the coercive measures were not to be renewed. The
French maintain that the last of these contingencies occurred,
Palmerston contends that it was the first. It is possible
that Wyse may have received instructions conformable with
this arrangement, and that he may have thought that the
course which Gros took brought the case within the former
category. This may have been an unsound opinion, but if
such was the case it exonerates the British Government from
the charge of having violated an engagement to that of
France. But in order to make this defence valid, it will be
necessary to prove that the instructions given to Wyse were
such as the French had a right to expect. It does not
appear that these instructions were ever imparted to them.
These are minute, however important, points; but emerging
from the confusion and perplexity of dates and circumstantial
details, the question is, what is the general impression
as to the whole conduct of the two Governments, more particularly
of our own, throughout the transaction. I reserve
the consideration of this till I have seen Palmerston's case
as set forth in the papers that are to be laid before Parliament,
and in the long and able despatch which he is said
to have written in explanation and defence of his conduct.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>May 25th.</i>&mdash;The morning before yesterday the Duke of
Bedford came here again. He had seen Lord John since, and
heard what passed with the Queen. She was full of this
affair, and again urged all her objections to Palmerston.
This time she found Lord John better disposed than heretofore,
and he is certainly revolving in his mind how the thing
can be done. He does not by any means contemplate going
out himself, or breaking up the Government. What he looks
to is this, that the Queen should take the initiative, and urge
Palmerston's removal from the Foreign Office. She is quite
ready to do this as soon as she is assured of her wishes being
attended to. For various reasons it would not do to put
Clarendon in his place. Clarendon would not like it, and it
would make Palmerston furious; therefore this is out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
question. The only possible arrangement is that Lord John
should himself take the Foreign Office, provisionally, and
he is quite prepared to take it. I told the Duke I entirely
agreed that this was the only feasible arrangement, and I
did not apprehend any danger to Lord John, because he
would do the business in a very different way, and manage
to lighten the burthen both by his mode of transacting it,
and by delegating many details to his Under-Secretary, instead
of, like Palmerston, doing everything himself. There
certainly never appeared to be so good a chance of getting
the Foreign Office out of Palmerston's hands as now; but
long experience of his boldness and success, and of the pusillanimity
and weakness of his colleagues, make me feel very
doubtful and uncertain as to the result. If the thing is
done, they mean to propose to him to take another office
instead; not to turn him out. I don't know how they think
of managing this, but he is sure to refuse to give up the
Foreign Office and take another instead of it. He would
consider this a degradation, and a sort of pleading guilty to
the charges that are brought against him. If he will lend
himself to this change, so much the better; if he does not
go out, the Duke thinks, not without reason, that it will be
almost impossible for Clarendon to come into office at present,
and that he ought not; his opinions on foreign affairs
are so strong, that he could not join the Cabinet while
Palmerston was at the Foreign Office without the certainty
of either very soon quarrelling with him, or of being obliged
to make concessions against his conscience and real opinions,
and which would therefore be discreditable to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPERS ON THE GREEK DISPUTE.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Palmerston has made his explanation in the
House of Commons. There is much difference of opinion as
to how it was received, but I gather that it was a good deal
applauded by the Radicals and his own people; it was clever
as he always is, but it was weak. As the case more develops
itself (for now all the Blue Books are out, French and
English), it resolves itself into a very small point: Did
Palmerston, or did he not, send instructions to Wyse in
conformity with what was agreed upon between himself and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
Drouyn de Lhuys? This is what the French have a right
to ask: if he did, let him show these instructions; if he did
not, he broke faith with the French Government. By Wyse's
letter of the 15th, it seems pretty clear he did not send any
such instructions. I do not see how volumes of Blue Books,
or all the conferences and debates imaginable, can put the
case in a clearer light, or bring it to a more direct issue
than this.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 2nd.</i>&mdash;I was never able to plunge into the Blue
Book till Epsom races were over, but I have now done it,
and have gone through both&mdash;that and the French Book.
The case is quite complete, and it is not difficult to extract
from the mass of details with which the former is uselessly
encumbered a clear view of the case. The result is a conviction
in my mind that the French Government acted with
amity and good faith, and that the conduct of Gros at
Athens was irreproachable. He did his best to bring about
an arrangement, and he failed because the requisitions of
the English Minister were such as in honour and conscience
it was impossible for him to support, sanction, or recommend
to the Greek Government. If Stanley works this case well,
he will make a great affair of it, for his materials are ample
and excellent. Palmerston's Blue Book is just like former
productions from the Foreign Office under him, voluminous
details of matter quite uninteresting and beside the question,
and the absence of those documents which we most require
to see, and on which the whole case turns, his instructions
to Wyse and Parker&mdash;none of which, or scarcely any, are
given.</p>

<p>The night before last was remarkable for the maiden
speech of young Stanley<a href="#Footnote_118" id="FNanchor_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
in the House of Commons. It
was very successful. He spoke with great fluency, and gave
promise of being a debater. I dined with Sir Robert Peel
yesterday, who said he heard him, and he spoke in terms of
great commendation of the speech. It was on the West
Indian question, on which he had just published and circulated
a pamphlet, and it was remarkable and showed a confidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
in his own powers that his speech did not appear to
be a repetition of any part of his pamphlet.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 6th.</i>&mdash;On Monday last Graham called on me at the
Council Office, and after talking about the Greek affair and
Stanley's motion, he proceeded to other matters about which
he had come expressly to speak to me as a channel of
communication with John Russell. With reference to the
first matter, he said that a negotiation was evidently going
on between Stanley and Aberdeen, and that the latter was
to support some of Stanley's domestic questions, and in
return Stanley would fight vigorously the foreign policy.
I did not pay much attention to this, for Graham is always
dreaming of this connexion and its results. He then went
on to say, that if there was (as there very probably would
be) an adverse vote in the House of Lords on Friday, the
Government would be very unwise if they attempted to
procure a counter vote in the House of Commons; and if
they tried it, he thought they would fail; but that they must
counteract the effect in another way; and that Lord John
had now an excellent opportunity of acquiring reputation
for himself and strength for his Government, by proposing
very important reforms of an administrative kind, and which
he was enabled to do by the abolition of the Lord-Lieutenancy
and the resignation of Lord Cottenham.<a href="#Footnote_119" id="FNanchor_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> What he
wants him to do is this&mdash;to give up the idea of a fourth
Secretary of State, to take away the criminal business from
the Home Secretary and give it to the new Lord Keeper, or
whatever the great legal functionary to be created may be
called. He thinks a fourth Secretary objectionable on many
accounts, and that Government would have great difficulty
in carrying it. He gave many reasons for this opinion
which seemed to me sound enough. Then he proposes that
all the Chancellor's ecclesiastical patronage shall be taken
from the Great Seal and made over to the Prime Minister;
the livings to be sold as they become vacant, and the proceeds
handed over to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
applied to ecclesiastical purposes, which he says would be an
immense boon to the Church, and by these means funds
might be raised which are greatly wanted, but for which it
would be impossible to apply to Parliament with any hope
of success. He urged these reforms with great energy, and
set forth all the advantages which might be derived from
them, and said Peel was still more eager, especially about
the Church patronage, than he was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANCERY REFORM.</div>

<p>The same evening I told the Duke of Bedford all that
had passed, and he said he would see Lord John the next
morning and speak to him. He did so, and came to me
afterwards on Tuesday morning. He said he had told Lord
John all that Graham had said, that he thought Graham
was always rather too much disposed to be running before
what he thought was public opinion; that with regard to
the fourth Secretary he was quite bent upon it, thought it
absolutely necessary (as Clarendon did also), and he was
determined to adhere to it. With respect to the question of
the Chancellor's livings, he agreed with Graham, and he had
brought before the Cabinet a scheme founded on Graham's
recommendations, but that it had been rejected by the
Cabinet <i>unanimously</i>. They thought it very objectionable to
part with so much patronage. However, though Lord John
could not under these circumstances press the matter at
present, he will not give it up, and still meditates some
measure of this character, though probably one less extensive.
Yesterday morning I called on Graham and told him
what had passed, at which he expressed great disappointment
and regret, and after as much talk as we had time for
(for I was going out of town), I left him provoked and disheartened.
He said he could take no interest in a Government
which rejected unanimously such a proposition as this,
and which had rejected unanimously the French invitation
to abide by the London Convention.<a href="#Footnote_120" id="FNanchor_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> I had told him this
which Beauvale told me, and which, as well as I recollect,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
I have not noted down. He said that when the French made
this proposal, Palmerston drew up a paper placing it before
the Cabinet with the reasons for accepting, and those for
rejecting it, and desired them to determine, himself taking
no part; and that they had unanimously agreed to refuse,
so that it was their act and not his.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 8th.</i>&mdash;Graham called on me again yesterday morning.
He had had a long conversation with John Russell
in the House of Commons on Wednesday (sought by John
Russell), in which Graham repeated to him at greater length
all he had said to me. The discussion was very frank and
friendly, but Lord John told him he could not give up the
fourth Secretary, and gave his reasons for thinking it necessary,
which Graham said were very weak ones. So they
parted, Graham hoping that he would at all events take time
for consideration, but he was much surprised and annoyed
at hearing him give notice he should bring on the Lord-Lieutenancy
Bill to-morrow. He thought this very uncourteous,
and it had thrown him into perplexity as to the
course he ought to take. He had a strong opinion upon
it, and he was convinced that if he opposed it, and stated
his reasons to the House of Commons, the clause would be
thrown out; that he neither liked going against his own
decided opinion, nor against the Government, and he did
not know what to do. From me he went to Lyndhurst, and
then to Peel, and then came back to me. Lyndhurst, blind,
but full of vigour and spirit, is full of the new arrangements
about the Great Seal. Lord John has consulted him on
the subject, and he is going to call on him. Lyndhurst is
against giving up the ecclesiastical patronage. Peel regrets
Lord John's determination, but Graham said he is so bent
on carrying the Government through the Session, that he
will not oppose them on anything. He thinks of nothing
but securing a fair trial for Free Trade, and keeping the
Protectionists out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON THE PACIFICO AFFAIR.</div>

<p>To-day I called on Lord Lyndhurst and found him in
great force&mdash;Brougham, Baron Alderson, Stuart (the Protectionist
Chancellor), Brodie, and Hatherton, and Strangford
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
were there. They were all discussing the legal reforms, and
Brougham broke out about Cottenham's earldom. Cottenham,
he said, wrote to him, lamenting that he disapproved
of this honour, which had been conferred on him as a mark
of the Queen's confidence and approbation of his services.
Brougham wrote in reply that he should not talk such
'Morning Post' twaddle, and that he knew very well the
Queen neither knew nor cared about his services, and that
he had got it because he insisted on having it! The new
appointments which are beginning to be known do not please.
Jervis to be Chancellor and at the head of the House of
Lords and Judicial Committee seems strange. [But this
arrangement was not carried into effect.]</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 18th.</i>&mdash;The great debate in the House of Lords
came off last night in the midst of immense curiosity and
interest.<a href="#Footnote_121" id="FNanchor_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
The House was crowded in every part; I never
saw so many Peers present, nor so many strangers. There
were various opinions about the result, but the Government
was the favourite. Bear Ellice offered to lay two to
one they had a majority. Most people thought the same,
but everybody was agreed that go which way it would, the
division would be a very close one, and the majority small.
Malmesbury, Stanley's whipper-in, counted on fifteen on his
side. Stanley spoke for two hours and three-quarters. He
has made more brilliant speeches, but it was very good,
moderate and prudent in tone, lucid, lively and sustained.
I heard him, and then was so tired of standing, I was
obliged to go away, and did not return. The Government
made but a poor defence. Canning made a capital speech,
and placed himself in a high position. He had taken great
pains with it, and it was very effective, every word told.
Granville told me Eddisbury was good too, and it was the
most important speech he ever made. I never was more
amazed than at hearing the division, never having dreamt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
of such a majority; <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="remains to be seen">reste à savoir</i> what Government (and
Palmerston especially) will do. If he was disposed to take
a great line he would go at once to the Queen and resign,
at the same time begging her not to accept the resignation
of his colleagues if they tendered it. This would be creditable
to him, and he owes them all the reparation in his
power for the hot water he has kept them in, and the scrapes
he has made for them for many years. They have over and
over again allowed themselves to be dragged through the
mire for him, and since they have refused now and heretofore
to separate themselves from him, the least he can do is
to separate himself from them, and to insist upon being the
only sacrifice.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 19th.</i>&mdash;There was a Cabinet yesterday, of course for
the purpose of considering what they should do, and the
resolution they came to was <i>to do nothing</i>. Labouchere saw
Granville before the Cabinet, and told him that <i>he</i> was all
for resigning, but he feared there was a disposition to stick
in amongst his colleagues, and, as he thought, particularly
in Charles Wood; but Delane, who saw Charles Wood after
the Cabinet, was assured by him that he would have preferred
to resign, but that he was overruled by the majority
of his colleagues. This is all I know of the matter, but it
by no means surprises me to find that they have resolved to
take no notice of the buffet they got from the Lords, and
go on. I now expect that John Russell will lay aside all
thoughts of getting rid of Palmerston, and the rickety
concern will scramble on as heretofore. Nevertheless it
is impossible this event and great majority should not produce
sooner or later very considerable effects. It will abroad
if it does not here. As to Palmerston's being corrected and
reformed, I don't believe a word of it, but the Foreign Office
will inevitably find itself in a situation of great difficulty
and embarrassment, and our relations with the rest of
Europe will in all probability assume a character mischievous,
dangerous, and intolerable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S ANSWER.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;It seems that the Ministers' minds misgave
them, and yesterday they began to doubt whether they ought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
not to do <i>something</i>. Roebuck gave notice of a question, and
John Russell told him he would give him an answer this evening.
John Abel Smith went and proposed that they should
make a sign of intention to resign, and that a vote of general
confidence should be moved in the House of Commons, on
which they should stay in. Many of the friends of Government
(some in office) are for resignation. It is no doubt
embarrassing, but I am against their resignation. If Palmerston
was disposed to take a high and creditable line,
he might extricate them from the difficulty by voluntarily
sacrificing himself. This is what he ought to do, but I
don't hear that he has evinced any disposition of the sort.
He did indeed offer to resign at the Cabinet, but this of
course (as he well knew) they could not listen to.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 21st.</i>&mdash;John Russell made his statement last night,
giving the reasons why he did not resign, quoting two precedents,
one above a century ago, and one in 1833, for not
resigning in consequence of an adverse vote of the House of
Lords. I concur in the constitutional doctrine he laid down
on that score, but the rest of what he said was very imprudent
and ill-judged. He has now committed himself more than ever
to Palmerston, and has thrown down a defiance to all Europe,
announcing that they will make no difference whatever
in their administration of foreign affairs. He alluded to
that part of Stanley's resolution which laid down the right
and duty of this country, asserted that the words of it
limited those rights and duties within bounds he could not
admit, and by implication at least asserted propositions
against which foreign nations will infallibly kick. It was
very imprudent to raise incidentally this very difficult and
important question, and he might easily have avoided such
dangerous ground. Then he finished by a very miserable
and injudicious claptrap, which will be as offensive as possible
to foreign Powers; in short, he evinced little judgement
and taste. It is clear enough that he is now resolved to
adhere to Palmerston, and that his intention is, if he can
get a majority next Monday, to disregard the House of
Lords and their opinions, and to set all Europe at defiance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
by giving them notice that they must have Palmerston to
deal with and nobody else. The conclusion to which he
came a few weeks ago is evidently thrown aside. All his
indignation against Palmerston, his determination to endure
it no longer, his bold resolution to take the labour of the
Foreign Office on himself, have all evaporated, and are as
a dream, and the fact of a large majority of the House of
Lords having condemned Palmerston's proceedings, language,
and conduct, instead of affording an additional reason, and
confirming him in the course he had thought of pursuing,
seems to have made him angry and obstinate, to have caused
a reaction in his mind, and engendered a determination to
cling more closely than ever to Palmerston, and fight his
battle at all risks and at any cost, in everything and against
everybody. The other day there was a general opinion
that if a vote of approbation was moved in the House of
Commons it would not be carried. This was Graham's
opinion, and so entirely did John Russell himself concur in
it, that he declared it should not be attempted, if the vote
of the Lords was adverse. All that is suddenly changed.
He now tries this experiment, and all the people I have seen
say Government will carry it. Bernal Osborne told me it
was certain, for the Whigs and the Radicals united could
not be beaten, and all the Radicals but four or five would
support the Government. Never was there such a state of
difficulty and confusion in my recollection. It is at last
come to what I long ago predicted, and Palmerston is
proving the ruin of the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. ROEBUCK'S VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>June 24th.</i>&mdash;Nothing of course thought of but the division
on Roebuck's motion.<a href="#Footnote_122" id="FNanchor_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
The general opinion is that there will
be a majority of about forty, but nobody knows what Peel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
will say or do, and many votes are quite uncertain. That
there will be some such majority none doubt, and it is put
about by the Government that they will resign if their
majority is less than that in the House of Lords against
them, which I don't believe, and it would be very absurd to
make it turn on a mere question of numbers. Lady Palmerston
and her belongings continue to make an active
canvass. On Saturday afternoon the news came of the
difference being settled, by our conceding to the French all
they demanded. Nobody seems to care, or it would be a
mortifying and a ridiculous conclusion, for we have not only
agreed to what we at first refused to the French Government,
but we have in fact gone back (with some modifications
as to detail) to Gros's propositions to Wyse, which the
latter so obstinately refused, and on his rejection of which
the blockade at Athens recommenced, and the quarrel with
France was based.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 25th.</i>&mdash;Little progress was made in the debate last
night; Graham made a strong speech. In the morning I rode
with Brunnow and had much talk with him. He spoke out
about Palmerston, though with great regret; said he had
done all he could in the way of warning and advice, to prevent
his running this headlong course; but he never could make
the least impression on him. He thinks there will be a calm
of a few months' duration, but that it will be impossible for
Palmerston to go on <i>long</i> at the Foreign Office. He complained
of the great interests of the world having been
sacrificed to this miserable affair, especially the Denmark
question; that it might have been settled long ago; and if
we had pacified France by accepting the London Convention,
the three Powers would have immediately set to work
to bring this knotty point to an end. He goes to Petersburg
in August. The Emperor, he told me, cannot comprehend
our political condition, and is at a loss to know
why the Queen does not dismiss Palmerston; and when he
hears of the division in the House of Lords, he will fancy
that the Government will resign in consequence of it.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 29th.</i>&mdash;I have been for two days in the country, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
the great debate was going on. Palmerston came out the
second night with prodigious force and success. He delivered
an oration four hours and three-quarters long, which has excited
unusual admiration, boundless enthusiasm amongst his
friends, and drawn forth the most flattering compliments
from every quarter. It is impossible to deny its great
ability; parts of it are strikingly eloquent and inimitably
adroit. It was a wonderful effort to speak for nearly five
hours without ever flagging, and his voice nearly as strong
at last as at first. The ability of it is the more remarkable,
because on an attentive and calm perusal of it, the insufficiency
of it as an answer and a defence against the various
charges which have been brought against him is manifest;
but it is admirably arranged and got up, entirely free from
the flippancy and impertinence in which he usually indulges,
full of moderation and good taste, and adorned with a profusion
of magnificent and successful clap-traps. The success
of the speech has been complete, and his position is now
unassailable. John Russell may save himself the trouble of
considering, when this is all over, how he may effect some
change involving the withdrawal of the Foreign Office from
Palmerston's hands, for they are now all tied and bound to
him in respect to the future as completely as to the present
and the past. These discussions and attacks, which
were to have shaken him in his seat, have only made <i>him</i>
more powerful than he was before; but whether they have
strengthened or weakened <i>the Government</i> is another question.
It now remains to be seen what the attitude and
animus of Foreign Powers will be, and what the character
of his future proceedings. The debate was on the whole
very able. Cockburn made a slashing speech, which will
probably procure for him the post of Solicitor-General.
Graham's and Gladstone's speeches were the best on the
other side. Peel was very moderate, and refused to go into
the details or to attack the Government on them. The
majority of forty-six was rather more than was expected by
either party.

<p class="entry"><i>London, July 1st, 1850.</i>&mdash;The day before yesterday Sir
Robert Peel had a fall from his horse and hurt himself
seriously. Last night he was in imminent danger. His
accident has excited the greatest interest, and his doors
are beset with enquirers of all parties without distinction.
He was in high spirits that day, for he was pleased with
the division which saved the Government, and with his
own speech, which for his purpose was very dexterous and
successful.</p>

<p>I rode with Lord Grey yesterday in the Park, when we
talked over the debate and present state of affairs. He said
that it was remarkable that this discussion, which was intended
to damage Palmerston, had left him the most popular
man in the country; that of this there could be no doubt.
Bright had said that his vote had given great offence at
Manchester, and that Cobden's vote and speech would probably
cost him the West Riding at the next election; that
amongst all the middle classes Palmerston was immensely
popular. He spoke of Palmerston's speech as having been
not only one of consummate ability, but quite successful as a
reply, and he insisted that their side had much the best of
the argument. I denied this, but acknowledged the ability
of Palmerston, and his success, though his speech was very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
answerable, if either Peel or Disraeli had chosen to reply
to it, which neither of them would. It is beyond all contestation
that this great battle, fought on two fields, has
left the Government much stronger than before, and demonstrated
the impossibility of any change, and it has as incontestably
immensely strengthened and improved Palmerston's
position; in short, he is triumphant, and nothing can overthrow
him but some fresh acts of violence and folly, of
insolent interference, of arrogant dictation or underhand
intrigue, which may be so flagrant that his colleagues or
some of them will not stand it, and so a quarrel may ensue.
But he has achieved such a success, and has made himself
so great in the Cabinet, and so popular in the country, and
made the Government itself so strong, that if he turns
over a new leaf, takes a lesson from all that has happened,
and renounces his offensive manners and changes his mode
of proceeding abroad, he may consider his tenure of office
perfectly secure. Even the 'Times' is prepared to abandon
its opposition to him, and is seeking for a decent pretext
to do so. I expect they have found out that they have gone
too far, and that their violent and sustained vituperation of
Palmerston who is liked, and of his policy which is not
understood, is not favourably received, and instead of carrying

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;The death of Sir Robert Peel, which took
place on Tuesday night, has absorbed every other subject
of interest. The suddenness of such an accident took
the world by surprise, and in consequence of the mystery
in which great people's illnesses are always shrouded, the
majority of the public were not aware of his danger till
they heard of his death. The sympathy, the feeling, and
the regret which have been displayed on every side and in all
quarters, are to the last degree striking. Every imaginable
honour has been lavished on his memory. The Sovereign,
both Houses of Parliament, the press and the people, from
the highest to the lowest, have all joined in acts of homage
to his character, and in magnifying the loss which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
nation has sustained. When we remember that Peel was
an object of bitter hatred to one great party, that he was
never liked by the other party, and that he had no popular
and ingratiating qualities, and very few intimate friends, it
is surprising to see the warm and universal feeling which
his death has elicited. It is a prodigious testimony to the
greatness of his capacity, to the profound conviction of his
public usefulness and importance, and of the purity of the
motives by which his public conduct has been guided. I
need not record details with which every newspaper teems.
Those who were opposed to him do not venture or are not
inclined to try and stem the current of grief and praise
which is bursting forth in all directions, and most assuredly
no man who in life was so hated and reviled was ever so
lamented and honoured at his death. I am not capable of
describing him with any certainty of doing justice to his
character and delineating it correctly; but as there are several
notices of him not very favourable in preceding pages, at such
a moment it becomes a duty to qualify what may have been
misrepresented or exaggerated on the information of others,
by expressing my own doubts as to the perfect accuracy of the
statements that were formerly made to me. The Duke of
Wellington pronounced in the House of Lords a few nights ago
a panegyric on his love of truth, and declared that during his
long connexion with him he had never known him to deviate
from the strictest veracity. This praise would be undeserved
if he had ever been guilty of any underhand, clandestine,
and insincere conduct in political matters, and it leads me
to suspect that resentment and disappointment may have
caused an unfair and unwarrantable interpretation to be put
upon his motives and his behaviour on some important occasions.
My acquaintance with Peel was slight and superficial.
I never associated with him, and never was in his house
except on two or three occasions at rare intervals. He
scarcely lived at all in society; he was reserved but cordial
in his manner, had few intimate friends, and it may be
doubted whether there was any one person, except his wife,
to whom he was in the habit of disclosing his thoughts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
feelings, and intentions with entire frankness and freedom.
In his private relations he was not merely irreproachable,
but good, kind, and amiable. The remarkable decorum of
his life, the domestic harmony and happiness he enjoyed,
and the simplicity of his habits and demeanour, contributed
largely without doubt to the estimation in which he was
held. He was easy of access, courteous and patient, and
those who approached him generally left him gratified by
his affability and edified and astonished at the extensive and
accurate knowledge, as well as the sound practical sense
and judgement, which he displayed on all subjects. It was
by the continual exhibition of these qualities that he gained
such a mastery over the public mind, and such prodigious
influence in the House of Commons; but it is only now
manifested to the world how great his influence was by the
effect which his death has produced, and by the universal
sentiment that the country has to deplore an irreparable loss.
Nothing but a careful and accurate survey of his career, an
intimate knowledge of the secret transactions of his political
life, and a minute analysis of his character, can enable any
one to form a correct judgement concerning him. He might
easily be made the subject of a studied panegyric, or as
easily of a studied invective; but either the one or the other
would of necessity be exaggerated and untrue. The sacrifices
which he made upon two memorable occasions, upon
both of which he unquestionably acted solely with reference
to the public good, forbid us to believe that he was ever
influenced by any considerations but such as were honest
and conscientious. Notwithstanding his great sagacity, it
may, however, be doubted whether his judgement was not
often faulty, and whether in the perplexity of conflicting
objects and incompatible purposes, he was not led to erroneous
conclusions as to the obligations imposed upon him,
and the course which it was his duty to pursue. It is very
difficult to account satisfactorily for his conduct on the
Catholic question. We must indeed make great allowance
for the position in which he was placed by his birth, education,
and connexions. His father was a Tory, imbued with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
all the old Tory prejudices, one of those followers of Mr.
Pitt who could not comprehend and never embraced his
liberal sentiments, and who clung to the bigoted and narrow-minded
opinions of Addington and George III. It is no
wonder then that Peel was originally an anti-Catholic, and
probably at first, and for a long time, he was an undoubting
believer in that creed. The death of Perceval left the Protestant
party without a head, and not long after his entrance
into public life, and while the convictions of his
youth were still unshaken, he became their elected chief.
For about fourteen years he continued to fight their battle
in opposition to a host of able men, and in spite of a course
of events which might have satisfied a far less sagacious
man that this contest must end in defeat, and that the
obstinate prolongation of it would inevitably render that
defeat more dangerous and disastrous. Nevertheless, the
man who eventually proved himself to be one of the wisest
and most liberal of statesmen maintained for years a struggle
against religious liberty, a struggle by which he was involved
in inconsistencies injurious to his own character, and
which brought the kingdom to the brink of a civil war.
It is now impossible to fathom the depths of Peel's mind,
and to ascertain whether during that long period he had
any doubts and misgivings as to the cause in which he was
embarked, or whether he really and sincerely believed that
Catholic Emancipation could be resisted and prevented. It is
strange that he did not perceive the contest to be hopeless,
and that such a contest was more perilous than any concession
could possibly be. But he declared that up to the period
of Lord Liverpool's death his opinions were unchanged and
that he thought the prolongation of this contest was not
unreasonable. I do not see how he can be acquitted of
insincerity save at the expense of his sagacity and foresight.
His mind was not enthralled by the old-fashioned and obsolete
maxims which were so deeply rooted in the minds of Eldon
and Perceval; his spirit was more congenial to that of Pitt;
and if he had let his excellent understanding act with perfect
freedom, and his opinions take their natural course, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
impossible to doubt that he would have concurred and cooperated
with the able men of different parties who were
advocates of Emancipation, instead of continuing to encourage
and lead on those masses of bigotry and prejudice
whose resistance produced so much direct and indirect mischief.
The truth is that he was hampered and perverted
by his antecedents, and by the seductive circumstances of his
position; and having become pledged and committed in the
cause, it was a matter of infinite difficulty for him to back
out of it, to recant his opinions, and change his course;
although any one who watched the signs of the times (and
no man watched or studied them more carefully than Peel),
might have seen that Catholic Emancipation was steadily
but surely progressing towards its consummation. For a
long time no events occurred so striking and important as
to produce a new state of things, and to scare by their disturbing
force those theories and principles, with which the
anti-Catholics blindly imagined they could plod on for ever.
To change the whole mind of Peel, and bring about an
abandonment of his long-continued policy, something more
was required than the accustomed signs of agitation, parliamentary
debates chequered by alternate victory and defeat,
and the accumulated power of eloquent speeches and
able writings. At length the crash came by which the
moral revolution was effected. The Clare election did what
reason, and eloquence, and authority had failed to do. The
Duke of Wellington and Peel simultaneously determined to
strike their colours, to abandon a cause which they had sustained
at great risks and by enormous sacrifices, and to
carry out the measure which their whole lives had been
spent in opposing, and which they had denounced as incompatible
with the safety of the country. Historical justice
demands that a large deduction should be made from Peel's
reputation as a statesman and a patriot on account of his
conduct through the last twelve years of the Catholic contest.
It may be doubtful in what respect he erred the most;
but whatever his motives may have been, it is indisputable
that he was the principal instrument in maintaining this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
contest, which terminated in a manner so discreditable to
the character, and so injurious to the interests, of the
country. For his share in this great controversy from first
to last, he must be held responsible to future generations.
But whatever his errors may have been, he made a noble
atonement for them, and having once changed his mind, he
flung himself into his new career with a gallantry and devotion
deserving of the highest praise. It would be easy to
show that if Peel had been actuated by selfish motives, by
regard for his own political interests and views of personal
ambition, other courses were open to him far better calculated
to promote such objects, and which he might have
adopted without any inconsistency; but he cast aside all
personal considerations and thought of nothing but how
he could most effectually serve the State. He encountered
without flinching the storm which he knew would burst
upon him, and bravely exposed his character and reputation
to suspicions, resentments, and reproaches, which might for
aught he knew be fatal to his future prospects. Upon this
occasion indeed, he shared the obloquy with the Duke of
Wellington, upon whom as Prime Minister the responsibility
principally rested. But the indignation and resentment of
the Tories fell, though unjustly, much more upon Peel than
upon the Duke. Peel was more emphatically the chief of
the anti-Catholic party, and in him it appeared a far greater
dereliction of principle. The authority of the Duke was so
great, and his followers were accustomed to look up to him
with such profound deference and submission, that they
could not bring themselves to attack him as the prime mover
in this obnoxious measure, and they therefore made Peel
the scapegoat, and vented upon him all the exuberance of
their wrath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEEL'S OPPOSITION TO THE CATHOLIC CLAIMS.</div>

<p>Their ill-humour and resentment led to the destruction
of the Duke's Government, and the change of Ministry
brought about the Reform Bill and the overthrow of the
Tory party. It is difficult to discern any proofs of sound
judgement and foresight in Peel's conduct in regard to Parliamentary
Reform. If he had adopted the same course as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Huskisson on the East Retford question, and manifested a
disposition to concede some moderate and reasonable reforms
as fit occasions presented themselves, it is by no means improbable
that the country might have been satisfied; but
his opposition to the transfer of the East Retford franchise
to Birmingham, together with the Duke's celebrated declaration
that the representative system could not be improved,
and that as long as he was in office he would oppose any
measure of Parliamentary Reform, convinced the Reformers
that they were resolved to make no concessions, however
slight, and not to suffer any change to be made in the existing
representative system. Peel evidently made an incorrect
estimate of the state of the public mind upon the question
of Parliamentary Reform. He could not indeed foresee the
French Revolution or its contagious effects here; but unless
the country had been already combustible, it would not have
been so inflamed as it was; and if he had been aware of its
temper and disposition, he never would have opposed the
general sentiment so pertinaciously as he did. I think,
therefore, that his course in respect to Reform exhibits a
deficiency in sagacity and foresight, and must be accounted
one of the blemishes of his political career. He fought the
Reform battle with extraordinary energy, and the skill and
perseverance with which he afterwards rallied the broken
forces and restored the fallen spirits of his party were
admirable. In 1835 the rash and abortive attempt of
William IV. to get rid of the Whigs made Peel the Minister
of a hundred days. This was the most brilliant period of
his life, and it was during that magnificent campaign that
he established the vast reputation which, while clouds of
suspicion and distrust, of enmity and dislike, were all the
while gathering about him, made him for nearly twenty
years by far the most conspicuous, important, and powerful
of English statesmen. He not only reorganised his party,
but he revived its political influence, and laid the foundation
for regaining its former power. His policy was as
successful as it was wise. He flung himself cheerfully and
confidently into the new order of things, associated himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
with the sentiments and the wants of the nation, and day by
day saw his reputation increasing both in Parliament and
throughout the country. The Tories abandoned themselves
to his guidance with a mixture of passive reliance and admiration
and of lurking resentment for the past with distrust
and suspicion for the future. They rejoiced in the chief
who made them once more powerful, and led them on to
victory; but they felt that there were no real sympathies
between themselves and him. While he was boldly advancing
with the spirit of the age, they were lagging behind,
gloomily regarding his manifestation of Liberal principles,
in which they did not participate, and lingering on those
traditions of the past which they saw that he had entirely
forsaken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEEL'S CONVERSION TO FREE TRADE.</div>

<p>At length, ten years after the Reform Bill, the Whig
Government was overthrown, and Peel became Minister.
At this time the great bulk of his supporters coveted power
principally for the sake of Protection. They believed that
it was the duty, the inclination, and the intention of Peel
to maintain the Corn Laws, and they had a right to think
so. He had been the vigorous and ingenious advocate of
the protective system, not, however, without some qualifications
and reservations, which, though they were enough to
excite the jealousy and mistrust of the most suspicious, were
still insufficient to neutralise the effect of his general professions.
It is almost impossible to discover what the process
was by which he was gradually led to embrace the whole
doctrine of Free Trade. We cannot distinguish what effect
was made upon his mind by the reasoning, and what by the
organisation and agitation, of the Anti-Corn Law League.
It would be interesting, if it were possible, to sum up periodically
the exact state of Peel's opinions upon commercial and
fiscal questions, and to know how he combined them with
other political as well as party considerations, which he was
obliged constantly to keep in view. No man but himself
could explain and vindicate the whole course of his conduct.
It may safely be assumed that when he began to reorganise
the Conservative party, he did not contemplate a repeal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
of the Corn Laws, and that it was by a severely inductive
process of study and meditation that he was gradually
led to the conception and elaboration of the commercial
system which the last years of his life were spent in carrying
out. The modification, and possibly the ultimate repeal, of
the Corn Laws must have formed a part of that system, but
what he hoped and intended probably was to bring round
the minds of his party by degrees to the doctrines of Free
Trade, and to conquer their repugnance to a great alteration
of the Corn Laws, both by showing the imprudence of endeavouring
to maintain them, and by the gradual development
of those countervailing advantages with which Free Trade
was fraught. That, I believe, was his secret desire, hope,
and expectation; and if the Irish famine had not deranged
his plans and precipitated his measures, if more time had
been afforded him, it is not impossible that his projects
might have been realised. He has been bitterly accused of
deceiving and betraying his party, of 'close designs, and
crooked counsels,' and there is no term of reproach and
invective which rage and fear, mortification and resentment,
have not heaped upon him. He has been unjustly reviled;
but, on the other hand, it must be acknowledged that, wise
as his views, and pure as his motives may have been, his
manner of dealing with his party in reference to the changes
he contemplated, could not fail to excite their indignation.
If they were convinced that the Corn Laws were essential,
not merely to the prosperity, but to the existence, of the
landed interest, he had been mainly instrumental in confirming
this conviction. It was indeed a matter of extraordinary
difficulty and nicety to determine at what precise period
he should begin to disclose to his supporters the extent of
the plans which he meditated. His reserve may have been
prudent, possibly indispensable; but although they were not
unsuspicious of his intentions, and distrusted and disliked
him accordingly, they were wholly unprepared for the great
revolution which he suddenly proclaimed; and at such a
moment of terror and dismay it was not unnatural that
despair and rage should supersede every other sentiment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
and that they should loudly complain of having been deceived,
betrayed, and abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEEL'S DIFFERENCES WITH HIS PARTY.</div>

<p>The misfortune of Peel all along was, that there was no
real community of sentiment between him and his party,
except in respect to certain great principles, which had ceased
to be in jeopardy, and which therefore required no united
efforts to defend them. There was no longer any danger of
organic reforms; the House of Lords and the Church were
not threatened; the great purposes for which Peel had rallied
the Conservative interest had been accomplished; almost
from the first moment of his advent to power in 1841 he and
his party stood in a false position towards each other. He
was the liberal chief of a party in which the old anti-liberal
spirit was still rife; they regarded with jealousy and fear the
middle classes, those formidable masses, occupying the vast
space between aristocracy and democracy, with whom Peel
was evidently anxious to ingratiate himself, and whose support
he considered his best reliance. His treatment of both
the Catholics and Dissenters was reluctantly submitted to
by his followers, and above all his fiscal and commercial
measures kept them in a state of constant uncertainty and
alarm. There was an unexpressed but complete difference
in their understanding and his of the obligations by which
the Government and the party were mutually connected.
They considered Peel to be not only the Minister, but the
creature, of the Conservative party, bound above all things
to support and protect their especial interests according to
their own views and opinions. He considered himself the
Minister of the Nation, whose mission it was to redress the
balance which mistaken maxims or partial legislation had
deranged, and to combine the interest of all classes in one
homogeneous system, by which the prosperity and happiness
of the whole commonwealth would be promoted. They
thought of nothing but the present sacrifices which this
system would entail on the proprietors of land, while he
thought only of the great benefits which it would ultimately
confer upon the people at large. Whether in 1847 he was
prepared for the unappeasable wrath and the general insurrection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
of the Protectionists, I know not; but even if he
viewed it as a possible alternative, involving the loss of
political power and a second dissolution of the Conservative
party, I believe he would have nevertheless encountered the
danger and accepted the sacrifice. If his party were disgusted
with him, he was no less disgusted with them, and
it is easy to conceive that he must have been sickened by
their ignorance and presumption, their obstinacy and ingratitude.
He turned to the nation for that justice which his
old associates denied him, and from the day of his resignation
till the day of his death he seemed to live only for the
purpose of watching over the progress of his own measures,
in undiminished confidence that time and the hour would
prove their wisdom, and vindicate his character to the world.
Though he was little beholden to the Whigs in his last
struggle in office, he gave John Russell's Government a constant,
and at the same time unostentatious support. That
Government alone could preserve the integrity of his commercial
system, and to that object every other was subordinate
in his mind. He occupied a great and dignified
position, and every hour added something to his fame and
to the consideration he enjoyed; while the spite and rancour
of the Protectionists seemed to be embittered by the respect
and reverence by which they saw that he was universally
regarded. His abstinence from political conflicts, his rare
appearance in debate, and the remarkable moderation of his
speeches made some fancy that the vigour of his faculties
was impaired; but if this was at all the case, it was only by
negative symptoms that it appeared, and was by no means
suspected by the community. Nevertheless, though his death
was so sudden and premature, and he was cut off in the
vigour of life, he could not have died at a moment and in
circumstances more opportune for his own fame; for time
and political events might perhaps have diminished, but
could not have increased, his great reputation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECTS OF PEEL'S DEATH.</div>

<p>It is impossible to foresee the political effects of Peel's
death. To John Russell and to his Government it is a
great loss, and the time may come when his absence will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
severely felt. Standing aloof from parties, known to have
no views of personal ambition, and giving them the benefit of
his influence and countenance, he would have been able to
afford them efficacious aid in the event of any Radical pressure,
and as long as he had lived he would have proved a
powerful coadjutor in resisting any attempts to assail or
undermine the Monarchy or the Constitution, It is against
the Radical supporters of the Government, and not against
the Protectionist Opposition, that he would have been mainly
serviceable. So far as these are concerned his death is more
likely to remove than to create difficulties in the way of
Lord John, inasmuch as he becomes more indispensable
than ever; and the certainty that there is no alternative
between him and Stanley&mdash;no Peel who in a great emergency
might have been called in&mdash;will certainly prolong his term
of office. Peel is a great loss to the Queen, who felt a
security in knowing that he was at hand in any case of
danger or difficulty, and that she could always rely upon his
devotion to her person and upon the good counsel he would
give her. But his relations with the Court at different
periods are amongst the most curious passages of his political
history. In 1838, when the Bedchamber quarrel prevented
his forming a Government, there was probably no man in
her dominions whom the Queen so cordially detested as Sir
Robert Peel. Two years afterwards he became her Prime
Minister, and in a very short time he found means to remove
all her former prejudice against him, and to establish himself
high in her favour. His influence continued to increase
during the whole period of his administration, and when he
resigned in 1846 the Queen evinced a personal regard for
him scarcely inferior to that which she had manifested to
Lord Melbourne, while her political reliance on him was
infinitely greater. To have produced such a total change of
sentiment is no small proof of the tact and adroitness of
Peel; but it was an immense object to him to ingratiate himself
with his Royal Mistress; he spared no pains for that
end, and his success was complete.</p>

<p>He appears to have suffered dreadful pain during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
three days which elapsed between his accident and his
death. He was sensible, but scarcely ever spoke. He had
arranged all his affairs so carefully that he had no dispositions
to make or orders to give. Sir Benjamin Brodie
says that he never saw any human frame so susceptible of
pain, for his moral and physical organisation was one of
exquisite sensibility. He was naturally a man of violent
passions, over which he had learnt to exercise an habitual
restraint by vigorous efforts of reason and self-control.
He was certainly a good, and in some respects a great
man; he had a true English spirit, and was an ardent
lover of his country; and he served the public with fidelity,
zeal, and great ability. But when future historians shall
describe his career and sum up his character, they will pass a
more sober and qualified judgement than that of his admiring
and sorrowing contemporaries. It is impossible to forget
that there never was a statesman who so often embraced
erroneous opinions himself, and contributed so much to
mislead the opinions of others. The energy and skill with
which he endeavoured to make the worse appear the better
cause were productive of enormous mischief; and if on
several occasions his patriotism and his ability were equally
conspicuous, and he rendered important public service, his
efforts were in great measure directed to repair the evils and
dangers which he had been himself principally instrumental
in creating.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CLARENDON ON THE LATE DIVISION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>July 16th.</i>&mdash;I have seen Graham once or twice lately,
when we have talked over his own position and the state of
affairs. He told me he had had very friendly communication
with John Russell, who had intimated to him that Peel's
death would necessarily place him in a position more important
and responsible. Graham, however, repudiated the
notion of his accepting any such position, and declared that
he was quite unfit to influence the opinions and regulate the
conduct of other men. He thought Peel was not unconscious
of the power he possessed in the country, and he had not
long ago announced with great energy that if any attempt
was made in any shape to reimpose a duty on Corn, there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
nothing he would not do to oppose it; and he thinks that
he would not have shrunk from any means he might have
deemed conducive to that object; that he would have taken
office if necessary, or have allied himself with any person or
party; in short, shrunk from <i>nothing</i> in the most extensive
sense of the term. Graham is much alarmed at the reckless
course Stanley is taking in the House of Lords, especially
with reference to the Irish Franchise Bill, and augurs some
very serious consequences from it.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 19th.</i>&mdash;Clarendon arrived from Ireland a few days
ago. He told me he had only seen John Russell for a few
minutes, in a great hurry as he was going to the Cabinet,
when these few words passed about foreign affairs. Clarendon
said 'they had got well out of their difficulties on that
score.'</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Lord John.</i>&mdash;Yes, I think it did&mdash;very well.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Lord Clarendon.</i>&mdash;Yes; but don't misunderstand me. If
what has passed serves as a lesson to Palmerston, and induces
him to begin another course of conduct, I shall think
you got very well indeed out of it; but if he only regards
what has happened as a triumph, and as sanctioning and
approving all his previous proceedings, then I shall think
you got very ill out of it, and that your success was a misfortune;
but I hope the former alternative is the truth.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Lord John.</i>&mdash;I hope so, too; but it is very difficult to get
any man who has long pursued any particular course to
change that course, more especially when that man is Palmerston.</p>

<p>From this Clarendon inferred that Palmerston means to
go on just as before and will not take a lesson from what has
occurred, and he is confirmed in this idea by something
Charles Wood said to him in the same strain.</p>

<p>Yesterday Normanby came to take leave of me before
returning to Paris. He has been very much dissatisfied
and annoyed at Palmerston's goings on, and at the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>
which was imposed on him, and he told me he did not like
Palmerston's tone, which was much too triumphant, and he
was very much afraid he would not change his ways of proceeding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
His best hope was that no case would occur to elicit
any fresh conduct or language of his of a questionable nature.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 28th.</i>&mdash;This day week the Radicals gave Palmerston
a dinner at the Reform Club. It was a sorry affair&mdash;a rabble
of men, not ten out of two hundred whom I know by sight.
They asked John Russell who would not go, and then they
thought it better to ask no more of Palmerston's colleagues.
Neither Lord John nor any of them liked it, but of course
they said nothing. Palmerston would have done better to
repose on his House of Commons laurels, and find some pretext
for declining this compliment. The Court are just as
much disgusted with him as ever, and provoked at his success
in the House of Commons.<a href="#Footnote_123" id="FNanchor_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p class="entry"><i>Brighton, August 26th.</i>&mdash;I have been here for a week
past. On Sunday last the death of Arbuthnot took place
at Apsley House, where he had been gradually sinking
for some time. He is a great and irreparable loss to the
Duke of Wellington, who is now left alone in the world.
Arbuthnot was almost always with him, he had his entire
confidence. The Duke told him, and talked to him, about
everything, and on the other hand, all who wanted to
approach the Duke for whatever purpose, communicated
through Arbuthnot. The Duke, who has for a long time
been growing gradually more solitary and unsocial, more
irritable and unapproachable, is now left without any friend
and companion with whom he can talk over past events, and
to whom he can confide present grievances and complaints.
He will feel it as acutely as at his age and with his character
he can feel anything.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MR. ARBUTHNOT.</div>

<p>Arbuthnot's career has been remarkable. He had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
shining parts, and never could have been conspicuous in
public life; but in a subordinate and unostentatious character
he was more largely mixed up with the principal
people and events of his time than any other man. He
might have written very curious and interesting memoirs
if he had only noted down all that passed under his observation,
and the results of his political information and
connexions, for few men ever enjoyed so entirely the intimacy
and unreserved confidence of so many statesmen and
ministers, and therefore few have been so well acquainted
with the details of secret history. He was successively the
trusted adherent and intimate friend of Lord Liverpool,
Lord Castlereagh, and the Duke of Wellington, and more
or less of almost all their colleagues, besides being on very
good terms with many others with whom he had no political
opinions in common. He had in fact a somewhat singular
and exceptional position; much liked, much trusted, continually
consulted and employed, with no enemies and innumerable
friends. This was owing to his character, which
was exactly calculated to win this position for him. Without
brilliant talents, he had a good sound understanding
and dispassionate judgement, liberality in his ideas, and no
violent prejudices. He was mild, modest, and sincere; he
was single-minded, zealous, serviceable, and sympathetic
(<i>simpatico</i>), and he was moreover both honourable and discreet.
The consequence was that everybody relied upon
him and trusted him, and he passed his whole life in an
atmosphere of political transactions and secrets. After the
death of his wife he lived at Apsley House when in London,
and during a great part of the rest of the year with the
Duke at Walmer and Strathfieldsaye, and he went hardly
at all into the world; but he rather extended than contracted
the list of his personal and political friends, for as
the Whig Ministers had often business to transact with the
Duke, they generally found it convenient to communicate
with Arbuthnot too; and, as he was always ready to render
any service, public or private, in his power, he made many
acquaintances and acquired friends in that party, specially the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Duke of Bedford, with whom he had long been intimate,
and who was in the habit of communicating with him very
unreservedly on political matters. The preceding pages
exhibit many proofs of Arbuthnot's familiarity with the
political history of his time, as well as of his good sense
and liberality. He was buried at Kensal Green, and the
Duke is said to have been very much affected at the funeral.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Brighton, August 27th.</i><a href="#Footnote_124" id="FNanchor_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>&mdash;Yesterday morning Louis Philippe
expired at Claremont quite unexpectedly, for though he had
been ill for a long time, it was supposed he might still live
many months. Not long ago his life was the most important
in the world, and his death would have produced a profound
sensation and general consternation. Now hardly more
importance attaches to the event than there would to the
death of one of the old bathing-women opposite my window.
It will not produce the slightest political effect, nor even
give rise to any speculation. He had long been politically
defunct. The effect that presents itself as most likely is its
paving the way to a reconciliation between the two branches
of the Bourbons, and a fusion of their interests; but as the
late King had consented to this fusion and desired it, while
the Duchess of Orleans was opposed to it, this consummation
is more likely to be prevented than brought about by his
death. His character has been often described with more
or less of truth and justice, and of course there will be
many fresh descriptions of it now. I cannot attempt it,
for I never knew anything of him except at second-hand.
He had certainly many good qualities and an amiable disposition,
and probably no vices but selfishness and insincerity.
These were, however, universally ascribed to him, and consequently
out of the limited circle of his own family and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
few friends and old servants, who were warmly attached to
him, he inspired neither affection nor respect. The worst
kings have seldom been destitute of many devoted adherents;
but in his day of tribulation, although he may rather
be accounted amongst the best than the worst, he was abandoned
by all France, and his fall was not only unresisted,
but suffered to take place with scarcely a manifestation of
sympathy and regret.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 10th</i>.&mdash;After a lapse of nearly three months
I resume my notices of past and present events, these
three months having furnished very little matter worth
recording nearly up to the present time. For the last
month, however, the world has been sufficiently agitated, on
different accounts and in different places, to afford ample
opportunity for either description or comment even to the
most superficial observer. I might, however, I have very
little doubt, write that which would be acceptable to one
person or another by recording my own personal experiences
and the communications that I have with different people
on different matters, which certainly are ludicrously miscellaneous.
Some people like politics, some gossip, and
almost all like political gossip. I have had within these
few weeks consultations and communications on the most
opposite subjects: men coming to be helped out of scrapes
with other men's wives, adjustments of domestic squabbles,
a grand bother about the Duke of Cambridge's <i>status</i> in
the House of Lords, a fresh correspondence with Lady Palmerston
about the 'Times' attacking her husband, communication
from Cardinal Wiseman about the troubled state
of ecclesiastical affairs, and so forth; odds and ends not
altogether uninteresting, and making a strange miscellany
in my mind. It is needless to attempt to say anything about
the solution of the German question, touching which I have
no private information whatever.<a href="#Footnote_125" id="FNanchor_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> It is a drama, at which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
all the world is audience, and I have not been behind the
scenes. I think we have played a very paltry part in it,
and Palmerston's policy and conduct are so unintelligible to
me that I shall say nothing about them. I agree in all that
the 'Times' has written thereon, and its strictures have hit
hard, as is evident by the resentment expressed by Lady
Palmerston.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cambridge and his family have been, and
still are, excited about the place he is entitled to occupy in
the House of Lords,<a href="#Footnote_126" id="FNanchor_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and they are very angry with me because
I said, in my pamphlet on Prince Albert's precedence
ten years ago, that he was only entitled to sit as Duke of
Cambridge according to the date of his peerage, and this I
adhere to now. It is incredible what importance they attach
to this nonsense. The Duchess of Gloucester sent to me to
beg a copy of that old pamphlet, and afterwards the Chancellor
did the same. I have had a correspondence with
Lord Redesdale about it, who has taken up the Duke's
cause, and sustained it by some very bad arguments and
very inapplicable precedents. I have stuck to my original
opinion, but nevertheless am now endeavouring to help the
Duke to attain his purpose, and have furnished him with a
better precedent than he and his advisers have been able to
find for themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PAPAL AGGRESSION.</div>

<p>But such trifles as these, and such serious matters as an
impending German war, are uninteresting in comparison
with the 'No Popery' hubbub which has been raised, and
which is now running its course furiously over the length
and breadth of the land. I view the whole of this from
beginning to end, and the conduct of all parties with unmixed
dissatisfaction and regret. The Pope has been ill-advised
and very impolitic, the whole proceeding on the
part of the Papal Government has been mischievous and impertinent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
and deserves the severest censure. Wiseman, who
ought to have known better, aggravated the case by his imprudent
manifesto. On the other hand, the Protestant demonstration
is to the last degree exaggerated and absurd. The
danger is ludicrously exaggerated, the intention misunderstood,
and the offence unduly magnified. A 'No Popery'
cry has been raised, and the depths of theological hatred
stirred up very foolishly and for a most inadequate cause.
John Russell, who acted prudently in declaring his Protestant
sympathies, joining the public voice in condemnation of the
Pope's proceedings, and clearing himself and his Government
from any suspicion of being indifferent to them, nevertheless
writes a very imprudent, undignified, and, in his station, unbecoming
letter. He might have said all that it was necessary
to say without giving any offence; he might have taken
the movement into his own hands, and satisfied the Protestants,
and at the same time not dissatisfied the Catholics,
pouring oil on the waters, and moderating the prevailing
effervescence. But his letter has had a contrary effect. On
one hand it has filled with stupid and fanatical enthusiasm
all the Protestant bigots, and stimulated their rage; and on
the other it has irritated to madness all the zealous Catholics,
and grieved, shocked, and offended even the most moderate
and reasonable. All wise and prudent men perceive
this, and strongly disapprove of his letter; all his colleagues
with whom I have spoken, and I have no doubt all the rest,
do so; and Clarendon writes me word that the effect it has
produced in Ireland is not to be told. I have already had a
practical proof of the mischief it has done. Two days ago
Bowyer came to me from Cardinal Wiseman, who was just
arrived, to ask my opinion whether anything could be done,
and what. I said if he had sent to me some time ago, and
told me what was contemplated, I might have done him
some service by telling him what the consequences would
be; but that now it was too late to do anything, John Bull
had got the bit in his mouth, and the Devil could not stop
him. He told me the Cardinal was drawing up a loyal
address to be signed by ecclesiastics and laymen, and asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
me to look at it. I agreed, and he brought it the next day.
I said it was very well as far as it went, and only suggested
that the new Bishops should take care to sign their names
only, and omit all allusion to their sees. This he engaged
for. I then talked over the case, and what might be done.
I said of course we could not expect the Pope to retract;
but that if he was really desirous of doing what could be
done to allay the prevailing irritation, he had better do that
which he still could consistently; that he had not yet pronounced
any decision as to the Irish Colleges, and he might
either give one in their favour, or at least abstain from
giving any at all, and the Cardinal would do well to urge
this at Rome. Bowyer replied that this might have been
possible before, but Lord John's letter had made it impossible
now, and that this letter would be regarded as so insulting
at Rome, and such a proof of the hostility of the British
Government to the Roman Catholic religion, that they would
put no trust in the writer of it, and it would be impossible
to ask the Pope, nor would he be induced, to do anything in
deference to the objects or wishes of this Government.</p>

<p>This odious agitation will continue till it is superseded by
something else, or expires from want of aliment more solid
than fanatical denunciations. Already sensible people, even
those who are indignant at the 'Papal aggressions' as they
are termed, begin to think the clamour exaggerated, that
we are going too far, and raising a spirit of theological and
sectarian hatred and enmity, which is dangerous and will be
very troublesome. They begin to reflect that a great movement
without a definite and attainable object is a very foolish
thing, and as it is quite certain that the Pope will not retract
what he has done, and that we can neither punish him nor
frighten him, that his ecclesiastical arrangements will be
carried into execution here whether we like it or not, and
that as we shall take nothing by all our agitation and clamour,
we shall probably end by looking very foolish. At
present everybody, Protestants, Puseyites, and Catholics, are
all angry, excited, and hostile. Some affect to be very angry
and make a great noise because they think it answers an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
end. John Russell is somewhat in this way, for I don't
believe he <i>really</i> cares much; the 'Times' newspaper does
the same, and blows up the coals for the sake of popularity;
but Delane, who begged me not to write, as I was inclined
to do, something in mitigation of the movement, told me he
thought the whole thing gross humbug and a pack of nonsense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANTI-PAPAL AGITATION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>November 21st</i>.&mdash;The Protestant agitation has been going
on at a prodigious pace, and the whole country is up:
meetings everywhere, addresses to Bishops and their replies,
addresses to the Queen; speeches, letters, articles, all pouring
forth from the press day after day with a vehemence and
a universality such as I never saw before. The Dissenters
have I think generally kept aloof and shown no disposition
to take an active part. A more disgusting and humiliating
manifestation has never been exhibited; it is founded on
prejudice and gross ignorance. As usual the most empty
make the greatest noise, and the declaimers vie with each
other in coarseness, violence, and stupidity. Nevertheless,
the hubbub is not the less mischievous for being so senseless
and ridiculous. The religious passions and animosities that
have been excited will not speedily die away, nor will the
Roman Catholics forget the insults that have been heaped
on their religion, nor the Vatican all the vulgar abuse that
has been lavished on the Pope. In the midst of all this
Wiseman has put forth a very able manifesto, in which he
proves unanswerably that what has been done is perfectly
legal, and a matter of ecclesiastical discipline, with which
we have no concern whatever. He lashes John Russell with
great severity, and endeavours to enlist the sympathies of
the Dissenters by contrasting the splendour and wealth of
the Anglican clergy with the contented poverty of the
Romanists, and thus appeals to all the advocates of the
voluntary system. His paper is uncommonly well done, and
must produce a considerable effect, though of course none
capable of quieting the storm that is now raging. Wiseman
does not evince any intention of receding in the slightest
degree, but on the contrary there appears to lurk throughout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
his paper a consciousness of an impregnable position, round
which the tempest of public rage and fury may blow ever so
violently without producing the slightest effect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Government are, I suspect, in a great fix.
They are all disconcerted and perplexed by Lord John's
letter. When the Cabinet met and this letter was shown to
them, Lord Lansdowne asked whether the letter had been
already sent, and when informed that it had, he declined
saying anything. As it was sent and published they thought
it necessary to do something, and the law officers were
accordingly desired to look into the law on the subject.
There can be little doubt that the law will not touch the
case, and they will hardly have the egregious folly to propose
fresh laws which would be quite inoperative. Violence,
menaces, and abuse never made any people flinch from their
religious opinions or abandon any line of conduct they might
have adopted in relation to them. The Catholics know very
well that in these days any serious persecution is not to
be apprehended, and, even if it were, the Roman Catholic
clergy, to do them justice, have never shrunk from enduring
any sufferings or privations to which they were exposed.
They would probably rather like than not to see some
attempt made here to revive penal laws, and to be exhibited
to the civilised world in the character of martyrs. From the
beginning I foresaw that we should cut a poor figure in this
affair, and this is sure to be the result, whether we do
anything or nothing. There is great difference of opinion
whether this agitation will prove favourable or the reverse
to the Roman Catholic religion in England, that is, to its
extension. The Roman Catholics themselves evidently think
we have by our violence been playing their game and that
it will promote their proselytising views. Time alone can
show how this will be. The Queen takes a great interest in
the matter, but she is much more against the Puseyites than
the Catholics. She disapproves of Lord John's letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN QUESTION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>November 26th</i>.&mdash;At Brocket from Saturday till Monday.
Nobody there; I found Lord Beauvale<a href="#Footnote_127" id="FNanchor_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> in good humour with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Palmerston, who, he assured me, had acted a very proper
and a very spirited part in reference to German affairs,
having had to fight against the violent and inveterate prejudices
of the Court, to which some of his colleagues were not
disinclined to defer. He said that although the Court were
quite powerless in such matters as the Greek or the Sicilian
questions, they could do a great deal of mischief in Germany,
for being in constant communication with their relations and
connexions there, they could exercise a good deal of indirect
influence, and he thinks they have not scrupled to encourage
the King of Prussia in his absurd conduct. A letter was sent
to Palmerston, doubtless written by Prince Albert, in which
they talked of Denmark wresting Schleswig from Germany,
and that the triumph of Austria would be fatal to the constitutional
cause. Palmerston replied that he had never
heard that Schleswig belonged to Germany, and as to the
constitutional cause it was more in danger from the King of
Prussia, whose conduct was putting all thrones in jeopardy.
Beauvale also showed me a letter from Berlin in which the
writer said that nothing was more important there than the
English press; and he begged me, as Palmerston was now
really doing all he could in the right direction, to get him
any support I could. Nobody knows whether this will end
in war or peace. Palmerston, always sanguine, says <i>peace</i>;
and Beauvale thinks, when Russia, France and England are
all trying to avert war, that it cannot ensue.</p>

<p>The Protestant movement goes on with unabated fury,
and the quantity of nonsense that has been talked and
written, and the amount of ignorance and intolerance displayed,
exceed all belief, and only show of what sort of metal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
the mass of society is composed. Of all that has been written
and spoken there has been nothing tolerable but the
Bishop of Oxford's speech, which was very clever; the letter
of Page Wood in the 'Times' in answer to Wiseman; and
everything without exception which has emanated from the
Archbishop of Canterbury. He has displayed a very proper
and becoming spirit with great dignity, moderation, and
good sense. All the rest is a mass of impotent fury and
revolting vulgarity and impertinence, without genius or argument
or end and object&mdash;mere abuse in the coarsest and
stupidest shape. It is not a little remarkable what a strong
anti-Papist Clarendon is. He writes to me in that sense,
but not so vehemently as he does to others; and I see how
his mind is inflamed, which is odd in so practical a man.
But this is obviously the result of the bitter hostility he has
had to encounter in Ireland from the Roman Catholic clergy,
notwithstanding the efforts he made to conciliate them.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 1st</i>.&mdash;I went to Brocket again on Wednesday,
and returned on Thursday. Palmerston and Lady Palmerston
were there, but I had no talk with her. Beauvale
told me that Palmerston was acting with good faith, and
doing what he could to avert war. Cowley had written from
Frankfort that it was reported there that in the event of
war we should support Prussia. Palmerston wrote back that
we certainly should not, and desired him to contradict any
such report. He sent his letter to the Queen by way of an
intimation of his course. Meanwhile Radowitz arrived, and
had hardly set foot in England before he was invited to
Windsor, the pretext being that he brought over a letter
from the King. Palmerston was not there, and John
Russell left the Castle the day he arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LETTER OF CAROLUS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>December 11th</i>.&mdash;I could no longer stand the torrent of
nonsense, violence and folly which the newspapers day after
day poured forth, and resolved to write a letter, which was
published in the 'Times' the day before yesterday, and
signed 'Carolus,' for I did not venture to put my own name
to it.<a href="#Footnote_128" id="FNanchor_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
Delane could not bear publishing it, because it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
in opposition to the strong line the paper has taken; and he
told me beforehand he must attack me. Accordingly they
replied to the article they published, but in very complimentary
terms and with very feeble arguments. Labouchere
told me last night this letter must do good, and make
people think calmly. However, the agitation continues with
unabated violence, and it is no wonder the masses are so
intemperate and absurd, when we see how ignorant and
senseless men are who ought to know better, and who pass
for being clever and well-informed; and hear the unreflecting
nonsense they talk, and the extravagant views they
entertain. Bear Ellice, who is by way of being wiser than
anybody, and thinks it is his vocation to advise everybody,
told me on Monday that he had advised Charles Wood what
to do, and this notable scheme was to place matters by
legislation on the same footing here that they had been
placed on in Prussia by <i>Concordat</i>. I told him it was impossible;
and when he insisted, I asked him if he knew what
the state of things was in Prussia: to which he was obliged
to admit that he knew nothing about it! Then we see the
Head-Master of Rugby School petitioning the Postmaster-General
to remove a letter-carrier because he is a Roman
Catholic! Clanricarde writes a very good answer, which is
in the 'Times' of yesterday. Graham came to town yesterday
on his way to Windsor, where he is asked to stay three
nights, and he came and passed two hours with me yesterday
morning. His opinions are precisely like my own, and he
has written a letter to Howard of Greystock, exactly in the
same spirit as 'Carolus;' he is not only very sensible but
very bold on the subject, and quite prepared to confront
public opinion in defence of the principles of religious liberty.
We discussed the whole subject at great length. He acknowledged
that the difficulty of the Government was very great.
I enlightened his mind as to the part Palmerston has
recently been playing in German affairs, which he was by
no means aware of, and I hinted to him that his joining
the Government would not be disagreeable. He owned that
Palmerston would no longer be an insuperable objection,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
but that he could not be a party to any measures savouring
of religious persecution, or even restriction. The Queen's
answers to the addresses will have satisfied him, and all
reasonable and moderate people; but I expect the zealots
will cry out. Nothing certainly ever was more guarded.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 13th</i>.&mdash;At Windsor yesterday for a Council.
My letter 'Carolus' has made a decided hit. Delane told
me yesterday that it had certainly produced a considerable
effect, as he could tell from the innumerable letters he
received about it, some for and some against. The Ministers
were for the most part shy of talking to me about it; but
John Russell came up to me and said, 'Well, I have derived
a great deal of information from your letter. I think it is
very good.' I laughed, and said, 'I'm glad you like it;
you ought to be pleased, because I have praised you up to
the skies, and described your speech as a model of wisdom.'
He laughed too, and said, 'Yes, but that was not the part
of it I liked the best.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH LORD PALMERSTON.</div>

<p>I brought Palmerston from the station in my brougham;
all very amicable. We talked about Popery and Germany,
and agreed very well; he mighty reasonable. I asked him
if he had had any conversation with Radowitz. He said
none, except of the most general kind. He thought Radowitz
had been advised to absent himself from Prussia,
and that the King, for the present at least, was entirely
with Manteufel. I then asked him what Prince Albert
said to the turn affairs had taken. He said Prince Albert
was reasonable enough; that he condemned the King of
Prussia as much as anybody could; that he had been in
favour of strengthening Prussia, and against the old Federation,
because he thought the influence of Austria in it was
too great, and that it was mischievously exercised; that the
condition that no organic change in the Diet could take
place there, without a unanimous vote, could not be endured;
and that he thought, while the influence of Austria
remained paramount, the liberal cause, and all advances in
civilisation and general improvement, must be paralysed; and
this was to a certain degree true. I said no doubt it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
desirable to see changes and improvements, and for various
reasons that Prussia should be powerful, if her power was
only acquired by fair means, and without trampling on the
rights of others, and on all obligations human and divine.
He said, 'Exactly, that is the real case; but her conduct has
been so wanting in prudence, in consistency, and in good
faith, that she has arrayed against her those who wish
best to her.' He told me the Pope had expressed great
surprise at the effect of his measures, and disclaimed any
intention of affronting the Queen or this country. The Pope
said he had been induced to take the steps he had done by
advice from this country, and Palmerston thinks that Wiseman
was probably at the bottom of it all.</p>

<p>I went last night to the Royal Academy to hear an anatomical
lecture by a Mr. Green.<a href="#Footnote_129" id="FNanchor_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
It was on <i>expression</i>, and
very well done. I never heard a man more fluent; he was
very lucid in his expositions and illustrations, and really very
eloquent.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Bowood, December 26th</i>.&mdash;Went on Tuesday in last week
to Panshanger, on Saturday to Brocket, Monday to London,
and Tuesday here; we were very merry at Panshanger. The
house and its Lord and Lady furiously Protestant and anti-Papal;
so we had a great deal of wrangling and chaffing;
all in good humour and amusing enough. At Brocket nobody
but the Bear (Ellice), who talked without ceasing, and told
me innumerable anecdotes about Lord Grey's Government,
and different transactions in all of which he had himself
played a very important part, and set everything and everybody
to rights with his consummate wisdom. He is a very
good-natured fellow, entertaining and tiresome, with a prodigious
opinion of his own <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="expertise">savoir faire</i>, vain and conceited,
though not offensively so; clever, friendly, liberal, and very
serviceable. They put me at Brocket in Melbourne's room,
and there I found a MS. book, containing copies of letters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
written by him to Lord Anglesey, while Lord Anglesey was
Lord-Lieutenant and he was Chief Secretary&mdash;very familiar
and confidential. They were very frank, and giving Lord
Anglesey a good deal of advice, which on some occasions he
seemed to require. Their good sense struck me extremely.
There was a detailed account of the Huskisson quarrel, and
the resignations thereupon, but it contained nothing that
was new to me. William Lamb (as he was then) thought
both the Duke and Huskisson were in the wrong; but he
resigned with the others, because, he said, 'he had always
thought that it was more necessary to stand by his friends
when they were in the wrong, than when they were in the
right.' Poking about to see what else I could find, I lit on
two very different MS. One was a book which I suspect
had belonged to Pen Lamb, containing entries and pedigrees
of hounds and horses; and the other was a commonplace
book of Melbourne's, which I had not time to examine much,
full of quotations, criticisms, comments and translations, exhibiting
various and extensive reading, especially of Greek
literature. The next time I go there, I will look at it again.

<p class="entry"><i>London, February 20th</i>, 1851.&mdash;I broke off what I was
writing two months ago, having been attacked by a severe
fit of the gout, which has tormented me on and off ever
since, partly deterring and partly disabling me from writing
anything whatever. Indeed I have been in a hundred minds
whether I should not here and now close my journalising,
for I don't feel as if I had, or was likely to have, anything
more to say worth writing about. It is perhaps no loss to
have omitted any notice of the meeting of Parliament, and
what has taken place with reference to the Anti-Papal Bill,
and other matters. Are not these things amply narrated in
all the newspapers of the day?&mdash;and I do not think I have
acquired any knowledge or information besides, or at least
none of any importance. I shall therefore not attempt to
go over the ground or any part of it, that we have been
travelling over for the last two months; but I am induced
to forego my purpose of shutting up my books and abandoning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
this occupation, partly from reluctance to quit it
entirely, and partly because I think we are in a very precarious
and difficult state, and that a crisis seems imminent,
fraught with great interest and great danger. In such circumstances
I like to write what I know and hear, and to
record my own impressions and opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL RESIGNS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Brocket, February 24th.</i>&mdash;Events have come quickly on us.
On Thursday night Locke King brought on his annual motion
for extension of the suffrage, and moved for leave to bring
in a bill. Lord John opposed it, but pledged himself that
he would bring in a measure next Session, if he was still in
office. Nevertheless he was beaten by two to one&mdash;100 to 52.
The Conservatives went away, no trouble was taken, and
this was the result. The conduct of the Radicals was offensive.
Locke King, after Lord John's promise, wanted not
to divide; but Hume, Bright, and their faction insisted on
dividing, and one of them (I think Bright) insultingly said,
'If you don't divide and beat him, he will throw over his
promise and do nothing.' It must be owned that he gave
some colour to this suspicion by his conduct. A few nights
before Hume asked him if he was going to bring in any
measure <i>this year</i>. He said he was not, but that he still
intended to do so, at what he should deem to be a fit time
for it: not a word of <i>next</i> year. This looks very much as
if his promise on Thursday was an impromptu got up for
the occasion. Still not a creature in or out of the House
expected he would regard such a defeat as this as a
matter of any importance, and great and general were the
surprise and consternation when Lord John got up, just
when the Budget was to have come on, and made an announcement
which was tantamount to resignation.<a href="#Footnote_130" id="FNanchor_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The
House dispersed in a state of bewilderment, and the town
was electrified with the news. At night there was a party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
at Lady Granville's, and there it became known that the
Government was in fact out. It seemed the more unaccountable
because Stanley had sent them word of what
had been resolved at his meeting, which was neither more
nor less than a sham attack on the Income Tax, which the
Tories did not expect or intend to succeed. Lord John, however,
had resolved to resign after Friday's check, not on that
account only, but on the cumulative case of many unmistakeable
symptoms of the hostility of the House of Commons
and the impossibility of his going on. So he thought
he had better 'do early and from foresight that which he
should be obliged to do from necessity at last,' as Mr. Burke
said on a different occasion. Nobody knew what he was
going to do,&mdash;none of his followers and subordinates. He
saw the Queen in the morning, to whom he no doubt imparted
his intention; then he assembled the Cabinet, where
it must have been settled, and then he saw the Queen again.
Lord Lansdowne was at Bowood, and ignorant of this decision.
Carlisle was engaged in the City, not at the Cabinet,
and heard from Grey when he came into the House of Lords
that they were out. In the evening I was at home and upstairs,
and many of the men came up to talk it all over. Ellice
said Lord John was quite right. However, I think such was
not the general opinion, nor is it mine. Looking at the
state of the country and the obvious difficulty, if not impossibility,
of forming any other Government, still more of
forming one entitled to, or which could obtain, the confidence
and support of the Crown and the country, I am
very strongly of opinion that he ought to have fought the
battle for some time longer, not to have yielded to any hostile
manifestations, or to the probability, however great, of
damaging or fatal defeats, but to have encountered without
flinching all the opposition he might meet with, and not to
desert his post till the worst he apprehended should actually
occur. Many people think that, in spite of appearances, he
would have weathered the storms; and though in the midst
of great difficulties, he would eventually have evaded or surmounted
them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>The conduct of the Protectionists about the Income Tax
showed how uncertain and little adventurous they were.
This is partly explained by the revelation that has been
made of the opinions of some of their leading men. It has
been for some time apparent that there is a great ambiguity
in the conduct of the party, different members of which hold
the most discordant and inconsistent language. Disraeli
the other night declared he was not going for Protection,
that it was out of the question in this Parliament, and that
the country must settle the question. Granby directly afterwards
says he is for Protection. In the House of Lords, on
a motion of Lord Hardwicke's when a great Free Trade
debate was expected, and when it was well known that
Stanley had been preparing a great speech, he never opened
his lips, and the whole thing ended briefly and flatly. But
the Duke of Richmond made one of his furious harangues,
pointed to Stanley as 'the Leader of the Protectionist party,'
and gave a eulogistic commentary on Disraeli's speech, asserting
that he only meant that the battle of Protection must be
fought on the hustings, where it not only would be fought,
but would be won. Still Stanley was silent, and did not
utter a word in approval or in repudiation of these sentiments
and intentions. Notwithstanding these ambiguities,
people still talked of the probability or the possibility of a
Protectionist Government. It was said that Stanley had
made up his mind to take it, if he could get it, and that he
was of opinion that, great as the risks and serious as the
consequences might be, it was better to encounter them all
than to let slip the best opportunity they should ever have
of ousting the Whigs, turning back the current of Free
Trade, and restoring the Protective system. Everybody was
looking with anxious curiosity for the decision of Stanley's
meeting on Friday morning, as to the course they should
adopt in reference to the Income Tax; and when it was
known (which it was not till after John Russell's announcement
in the House of Commons), the impression was that
they were afraid to fight on that question; but at night I
heard a very strange thing, which placed the condition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
and prospects of that party in quite a new light. Two
of the best men they have in the House of Commons are
Walpole and Henley, especially the first. Walpole told
Jocelyn in the House of Commons that he would have nothing
to do with any Government that would attempt to
reimpose any duty on foreign corn, and he added that Henley
was of the same mind; and so, in fact, were at least half the
members of his party. This statement Walpole made twice
over to Jocelyn, and he said the same thing to others besides.
If such were the sentiments of some of their best men, what
was to become of Protection? how was the battle to be
fought on the hustings? and how was Stanley ever to form
a Government, and on what principles?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROTECTIONISTS.</div>

<p>However, the Government had resigned; somebody must
be sent for, and something must be done. Oddly enough,
while all this was going on in the House of Commons,
Stanley was dining at the Palace. Yesterday morning the
'Times' (whose editor was at Lady Granville's party) announced
the news to the astonished town. I went to my
office, where presently Labouchere, Carlisle, Granville, and
Evelyn Denison came into my room. Labouchere gave John
Russell's reasons for resigning, which to me seemed quite
insufficient, and I told them why. Carlisle said nothing,
and I suspect agreed with me. Denison did entirely. I
then came down here, where I found Brougham fall of
indignation and disapprobation of the hasty resignation,
and talking mighty good sense about the whole question
and the aspect of affairs. We heard this morning that
Stanley had been with the Queen, had refused to take office
for the present, but said he did not refuse absolutely if no
other Government could be formed; and that John Russell,
Aberdeen, and Graham met afterwards at the Palace. So
matters stand up to this time.<a href="#Footnote_131" id="FNanchor_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<p>I have seen a great deal of Graham lately, and he has
talked to me with considerable openness about the state of
affairs, present and prospective; the condition and prospects
of the Government, and their recent conduct, pointing out
many of the faults they have committed, and what they
might have done. He found great fault with Charles Wood's
Budget, and his general opinion was that the Government
could not go on, and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="whatever it costs">coûte que coûte</i> that we must pass
through the ordeal of a Protectionist Government&mdash;not that
he thought it would stand long, and he was aware that the
experiment would be attended with great peril to our institutions,
and might lead to very serious consequences. Still
that it was inevitable. He said that his joining the Government
now would be of no use to them whatever, and he
should only involve himself in, without averting, their fate.
He was evidently much pleased and satisfied with his own
speech on Disraeli's motion.<a href="#Footnote_132" id="FNanchor_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> He was conscious of its
success, and of the great service he had rendered the Government;
for, while disapproving of much that they have done,
he is now desirous of reconciling himself with his old friends,
looks hereafter to coming into power with them, and is
excessively pleased at having put himself on amicable terms
with John Russell. He told me that he had said to John
Russell the other day, that though circumstances had separated
them, and placed them for a long time in opposition
to each other, it would always be satisfactory to him to
remember, that on the three great questions which he
regarded as the most important of his political life, they
had been agreed, and had taken the same part, sometimes
together and sometimes independently. These were the
Catholic Question, Reform in Parliament, and the Repeal of
the Corn Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEELITES NEGOTIATE WITH THE WHIGS.</div>

<p>I found Graham in very low spirits, and full of disquiet
and apprehensions about the future prospects of the
country. This is generally his disposition, and he has communicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
much of his alarm and anxiety to me. On Friday
morning, after Locke King's division, and before he knew
anything of John Russell's intention, I received a note from
him in these terms: 'My anticipations are most gloomy. I
foresee nothing but confusion; there are no means of escaping
it; everything will be shaken, and something more
than a Government, I fear, will fall. The "Times," I see,
has passed sentence of death on the Administration this
morning. It is most likely it will be executed speedily,
and I doubt whether for their sakes it may not be said, the
sooner the better. They have lost all command over the
House of Commons, and indistinct promises of democratic
change when made by a Prime Minister are most dangerous,
for vagueness encourages hope, and the hope is deferred.
This state of doubt and fear cannot last much longer; the
public on all hands would greatly prefer a struggle and a
settlement.' When he wrote these lines John Russell had
already made up his mind to resign.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, February 25th.</i>&mdash;I came to town yesterday morning
and found everything unsettled: Aberdeen, Graham, and
John Russell trying to agree upon some plan, and to form a
Government. At half-past four Delane came into my room,
straight from Aberdeen. Aberdeen told him he was still
engaged in this task, but, he owned, with anything but
sanguine hopes of success. Delane said to him he hoped
if he did succeed he would not overlook the numbers and
importance of the Liberal party. Aberdeen replied, 'You
may rest assured that I am well aware of their importance,
and I believe I am at least as <i>Radical</i> as any of those who
are just gone out.' I went to Brooks's, found it very full
and excited; some persuaded Graham and his friends would
come to terms and patch the thing up. Bear Ellice and
others thought it impossible, and that Stanley is inevitable.
In the House of Commons John Russell made his statement,
and when he had made it Disraeli, without tact or decency,
denied that it was correct. John Russell was not very discreet
in what he said. He ought not to have said a word,
nor need he, of what passed between Stanley and the Queen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
Disraeli disgusted everybody by what he said, and his manner
of saying it. Lord Lansdowne, Carlisle, and Labouchere
dined here (Bruton Street), and about eleven o'clock a box
was brought to Lord Lansdowne. It was a circular from
John Russell announcing the final failure of the Graham
negotiation, and that everything was at an end. It broke
off on the Papal Question, on which they could not come to
an agreement, though John Russell was ready to make some
concessions. I don't think Graham wished to complete
any combination, and preferred throwing the thing back on
Stanley. His extreme timidity and his inveterate habit
of magnifying dangers and exaggerating difficulties are
very unfortunate and seriously mar his efficiency. If he
had some of the confidence and sanguine disposition of
Palmerston&mdash;if he could only bring himself to think that
'dangers disappear, when boldly they are faced,' it would
be better for the country and for himself. Gladstone is
expected to-morrow; Sidney Herbert says he will not
join a Stanley Government. Everybody goes over the
lists of Peers and Commoners whom Stanley can command,
and the scrutiny presents the same blank result of
men without experience or capacity, save only Herries, who
is past seventy, and has been rusting for twenty years and
more; and Disraeli, who has nothing but the cleverness of
an adventurer. Nobody has any confidence in him, or supposes
he has any principles whatever; and it remains to be
seen whether he has tact and judgement enough to lead the
House of Commons. It seems that in these negotiations
everybody has behaved well. There have been no difficulties
about persons, no pretensions, no selfishness, no vexatious
obstacles from or in any quarter. Had the thing been
patched up, Charles Wood was resolved to go. They wanted
him to change his office, but he would not hear of it, and
said he would not face Halifax. He thought both Grey and
Palmerston ought to go out with him, but they declare that
one and all were ready to make any sacrifice that might be
required.<a href="#Footnote_133" id="FNanchor_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD STANLEY'S ATTEMPT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 26th.</i>&mdash;Nothing more known yesterday except
that Stanley had accepted the task of <i>trying</i> to form a Government.
From the Queen he went to Aberdeen, and from him
to Lord Canning. As I don't know what passed, I will
say no more. This morning Lord Lansdowne sent for me,
and on leaving him I met John Russell. He told me Stanley
was to give his answer to the Queen <i>to-day</i>, though Gladstone
is not come. I asked him what he thought would
be the result. He was inclined to think it would be <i>No</i>.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 27th.</i>&mdash;It appears that Stanley was to say yesterday
whether he would <i>try</i> or not. He is trying. Canning and
Gladstone having refused, it remains to be seen whether he
can and will make a Government out of his own party.
Most people think he will not. Everybody asks, nobody can
tell, whether he will throw over Protection or go for it. His
followers now say nothing about <i>Protection</i>, but ask for
<i>confidence</i>. His rabble are very violent, and abuse him for
not at once taking the Government. This does not make
his position easier. Disraeli has behaved very well and told
Stanley to do what he pleased with him; he would take any
office, and, if he was likely to be displeasing to the Queen,
one that would bring him into little personal communication
with her. If he could get anybody essential to his Government
to join (Gladstone, of course), he would act under him.
All along everybody seems to have acted personally well.
The town is in a fever of curiosity, incessant enquiries and
no answers, heaps of conjectures and lies. I dined at Grillon's
last night; Graham in the chair, in high spirits. He
said, if Stanley took the Government, he <i>must</i> dissolve on
Friday night. But even if disposed, it is said that this
would be impossible, and that he must get the Mutiny Bill
and a money vote before he dissolves.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>February 28th.</i>&mdash;I met Gladstone yesterday morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
From the tone of his conversation his negotiation with
Stanley must have been very short indeed. He said he had
come over entirely on account of the Papal Bill. After another
day of curiosity, and rather a growing belief that Stanley
would form a Government, it was announced in the afternoon
that he had given it up. He had a meeting of some of his
principal friends, and they agreed with him in the propriety
of his resigning the task. Great excitement at night, and
the Whigs in extraordinary glee, foreseeing the restoration
of John Russell and his colleagues. The Ministers were all
to meet at Lansdowne House this morning and determine
on the next move. Lord John, who is rather sore, and not
unconscious of the blame that attaches to him, said with
some bitterness to Granville yesterday, 'Lady Palmerston
called on Lady John for the purpose of telling her that all
that has happened is my fault. Lady John might have told
her that if Palmerston had chosen to be present on Locke
King's motion, and have spoken, it probably would not have
happened at all.' Lady Palmerston is evidently provoked
that Palmerston has not been thought of to form a Government
in all this confusion, and at hearing so much of
Clarendon and Graham, and nothing of her husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD STANLEY'S FAILURE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;I went to the House of Lords on Friday
to hear Stanley's statement. He made a very good speech
and a lucid statement. Nothing could be more civil and
harmonious than all that passed; great moderation and
many compliments. The impression on my mind was that
Stanley was sick to death of his position as leader of the
Protectionists, and everybody agrees that he has been in
tearing spirits these last days, and especially since the
announcement of his failure. His conduct seems obnoxious
to no reproach, and he did what he was bound to do with
reference to the Queen and his party. They would have
been intolerably disgusted if he had left untried any means
of forming a Government, and though there will be some
grumbling and much mortification and disappointment
amongst them, they have no cause for complaint. He tried
everything and everybody, as I believe, without either the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
desire or the expectation of succeeding. Nothing surprises
me more than that anybody should think he could form
a Government, as many very acute people did. What happened
was almost sure to happen&mdash;the fear and reluctance
of many of his own people to undertake a task for which
they were conscious they were unfit. A man must be very
ambitious and very rash and confident, who, when it comes
to the point, does not hesitate to accept a very important and
responsible office without having had any official experience,
or possessing any of the knowledge which a due administration
of the office demands. It was not, however, without
some appearance of sarcasm and bitterness that Stanley
spoke of the men of his own party, who for various reasons
had declined to take office. The man whose private affairs
prevented him was Tom Baring; the modest man was
Henley, who is said to have told Stanley that he would not
<i>disgrace</i> his Government by presenting himself to the House
of Commons as Home Secretary; the man who thought it
would not last is said to be Thesiger. Sugden accepted the
Great Seal, and the Duke of Northumberland the Admiralty,
for which nobody imagines that he has any qualification
whatever; and it shows what slender materials Derby could
command when he applied to such a man.</p>

<p>John Russell made a poor speech in the other House, and
his peroration was a failure. The speeches of Aberdeen and
Graham showed that any coalition is out of the question,
and nothing will induce them to be parties to the Papal
Bill. I think them too stiff on this question, and can see
no reason why they should not consent to be parties to a
measure which they admit to be indispensable. It would
have been one thing to consent to its introduction, but it is
another to consent to its going on, and with great modifications,
after it had been once introduced.<a href="#Footnote_134" id="FNanchor_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="That which ought not to be done, when done, is valid">Fieri non debuit,
factum valet.</i> But Graham has all along had a fixed idea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
that we must pass through what he calls the ordeal of a
Stanley Government, and he has been continually hoping,
and partly expecting, that Stanley would make the attempt.
His object was reconciliation with John Russell and the
Whigs, and ultimate junction with them, after Stanley
should have failed, and I can't help thinking these notions
and views have confirmed him in scruples he might otherwise
have got over.</p>

<p>On Friday morning the Queen resolved to send for the
Duke of Wellington, which, however, was in reality a mere
farce, for the Duke can do nothing for her, and can give her
no advice but to send for John Russell again. He was
on Friday at Strathfieldsaye receiving the Judges and the
County, so he only came to town yesterday. I do not know
what passed between Her Majesty and his Grace, but Lord
Lansdowne went to her again in the afternoon, and so matters
stand at present, nobody doubting that the Government
will stay in as they are, and without any change. Labouchere
confided to me that the majority of the Cabinet did not wish
for any renewal of negotiation or any coalition with Graham,
though he did himself, which does not at all surprise me.
No reconciliation, no necessity for his co-operation, and no
manifestation of goodwill on his part, will do away with all
the jealousy and dislike with which many of the Whigs regard
the Peelites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RETURNS TO OFFICE.</div>

<p>I have been annoyed and disgusted at the part the
'Times' has taken latterly, turning round upon the Government
and upon John Russell in particular with indecent
acrimony. They have attempted a defence of their conduct,
but it is a very lame one, and they have been very severely
and very justly handled by the other papers, especially by
the 'Daily News.' No doubt John Russell has committed
great errors, and may be reproached for carelessness and
bad management. He has incurred much odium with certain
parties; he has lost a good deal of his authority and
influence in the House of Commons; but he is not a man to
be flung aside as damaged and used up, nor can his faults
and mistakes, either of omission or commission, cancel the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
antecedents of a long political life or deprive him of the great
position which, in spite of them and of appearances, he still
holds in the estimation of the Whig party and the country.
Nobody can be more sensible of the faults of his character
and of the blunders he has committed than I am; but he has
still great qualities, and I do not believe the Government
could go on without him.</p>

<p>I heard last night the details of the Notts election, which
appears to have been lost by bad management. It was a
very foolish thing in Lord Manners to put up his son at all,
but having done so, he ought to have left no stone unturned
to secure the victory. The effect of this contest and the
breach between landlords and tenants, unless it can be
repaired, presents the most alarming sign of the times.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 4th.</i>&mdash;The last act of the drama fell out as everybody
foresaw it would and must. The Duke of Wellington
advised the Queen to send for Lord John again. He was
sent for, and came back with his whole crew, and without
any change whatever. This was better than trying some
trifling patch-up, or some shuffling of the same pack, and it
makes a future reconstruction more easy. Last night it
was announced to both Houses, and coldly enough received
in the House of Commons. There can be no doubt that Lord
John returns damaged, weak, and unpopular. His personal
and social qualities are not generally attractive, and this is
a great misfortune in such circumstances of difficulty. It
is very difficult to say how they will be able to go on, and
what sort of treatment they will experience from the House
of Commons. The only thing that will obtain for them
anything like forbearance and support will be the very
general dread of a dissolution, and the anxiety of members
to stave it off. This may get them through the Session; but
their friends are nervous, frightened, and uneasy, and the
general opinion is that they will break down again before
the end of it. If they do, they must dissolve, for that is the
only alternative left.</p>

<p>Lord Granville dined at the Palace last night, and the
Queen and Prince Albert both talked to him a great deal of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
what has been passing, and very openly. She is satisfied
with herself, as well she may be, and hardly with anybody
else; not dissatisfied personally with Stanley, of whom she
spoke in terms indicative of liking him. She thinks John
Russell and his Cabinet might have done more than they
did to obtain Graham and the Peelites, and might have
made the Papal question more of an open question; but
Granville says that it is evident she is heart and soul with
the Peelites, so strong is the old influence of Sir Robert,
and they are very stout and determined about Free Trade.
The Queen and Prince think this resuscitated concern very
shaky, and that it will not last. Her favourite aversions
are: first and foremost, Palmerston; and Disraeli next. It
is very likely that this latter antipathy (which no doubt
Stanley discovered) contributed to his reluctance to form a
Government. Such is the feeling about him in their minds.
It is difficult to penetrate Palmerston's conduct and motives
during the late crisis; but I am much inclined to think he
was playing, or at least looking for an occasion to play, a
part of his own.<a href="#Footnote_135" id="FNanchor_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DISLOCATION OF PARTIES.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;At Brocket from Tuesday till Thursday.
In the morning I saw Graham and had a long talk with
him, principally about the Papal Bill. I asked him why he
could not make up his mind to support the amended and
curtailed Bill, which would not be inconsistent with his original
objection to any measure; but he went into the whole
question and satisfied me of the impossibility of his supporting

and defending (as he must have done) any measure
whatever. The truth moreover is, that he was not sorry to
have this excuse for keeping aloof, for if he could have got
over this, there still remained behind the great difficulty
of Palmerston. This was never touched upon at all, and
consequently they were all able to say there were no <i>personal</i>
difficulties; but Graham was satisfied that if he had joined
them, he and Palmerston should have speedily disagreed,
and I do not think any coalition will ever be possible which
embraces Palmerston's remaining at the Foreign Office. My
own opinion is that Graham wished Stanley's Government
to be formed; and I am confirmed in this view by the remarkable
fact that he and Aberdeen <i>advised</i> Lord Canning
to accept Stanley's offer. Canning told Granville this,
and I asked Graham if Aberdeen had advised Canning to
do so, and why. He replied, rather evasively, that it was a
great temptation; that Canning was not committed to Free
Trade; and that Aberdeen had suggested there was no objection
if he was disposed to accept. It was, however, very
strange advice. Granville thinks very ill of the prospects
of the Government, and has no reliance on their <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="expertise">savoir faire</i>.
Meanwhile there they are again, having lost something
in reputation, while it is questionable whether they have
gained much in support; but, I think, <i>something</i>. There is
a greater disposition to toleration, and to let them work
through the Session, for everybody dreads a dissolution.
There is a universal feeling of doubt, disquiet, and insecurity.
Parties are dislocated; there is no respect for, or
confidence in, any public men or man. Notwithstanding the
creditable manner in which every actor in the late crisis is
said to have played his part, and the fairness, unselfishness,
public spirit, and mutual urbanity and politeness displayed
by all, there lurks under this smooth surface no little jealousy,
dislike and ill-will; in truth, in all that passed, nobody was
in earnest. The Government threw up their offices not
wishing to resign. Stanley did not desire, and did not
intend, if he could possibly avoid it, to form a Government;
Graham did not wish to coalesce with the Whig Government,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
nor they with him. John Russell would have taken
him in, if they could have agreed; but most of his colleagues
hated the idea of coalition; he would have been ill received
by most of the adherents of the Government, and he is himself
persuaded that he should not have gone on long without a
difference of some sort. Many great difficulties, as they
would have proved, were never touched upon, particularly
who were to come in, and who were to go out.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;I was interrupted, as I was writing, by the
arrival of Graham himself, who stayed two hours, talking
over everything. He left no doubt about his wishes for
Stanley's forming a Government, for he told me that he
never was more sorry for anything than for his failure. He
still contemplates the great probability of such a Government,
supposing a dissolution to take place, and the return
of a Parliament prepared to vote for an import duty, and his
mind is still bent on a joint action between himself and the
Whigs <i>in opposition</i>. This is what he wants. He is not
aware of the antipathy there is towards him on the part of
many of them. Lord Grey, for example, is very bitter against
him, and <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="only changing">tantum mutatus</i>, that he is now the warmest supporter
and most zealous colleague of Palmerston! John
Russell told Graham that last year Palmerston strongly
urged him to get Graham to join them and take office, if he
could be persuaded to do so. This is curious enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANTI-PAPAL BILL.</div>

<p>Graham again entered at great length into all the objections
against the Papal Bill, and the bad policy and mistakes
of the Government. He thought it was one to have put up
George Grey to usher it out, when John Russell had himself
ushered it in;<a href="#Footnote_136" id="FNanchor_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
for he said it was both evident and notorious
that George Grey was in favour of stringent measures, and
his speech was one in favour of the clauses the omission of
which he was announcing. He said the announcement was
very ill received, and he thinks the Bill will not pass. He
fancies the Protectionists will throw it out, in which I disagree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
with him. There is an idea that they will try and
make it more stringent, by proposing to retain the clauses
or some other way; but this would be the best thing for the
Government, and would bring Whigs, Radicals, and Irish
all together. Meanwhile the effect of all that has happened
is as bad as possible. I said in my letter (Carolus), 'We
shall assuredly look very foolish if all the hubbub should
turn out to have been made without some definite, reasonable,
and moreover attainable object; and yet we appear
to be in imminent danger of finding ourselves in this perplexing
and mortifying predicament.' Never, I may make
bold to say, was any prediction more signally accomplished
than this. Everybody seems disgusted, provoked, and
ashamed at the position in which we are placed. The
Roman Catholics alone are chuckling over their triumph
and our perplexity. They see that we have plunged ourselves
into a situation of embarrassment, which leaves us no
power of advancing or receding without danger or disgrace.
Our Government, and especially its chief, have gone on from
one fault and blunder to another. They manage to conciliate
nobody, and to offend everybody. Their concessions
are treated with rage and indignation on one side, and with
scorn and contempt on the other. The Bill is reduced to a
nullity, but this does not appease the wrath of the Irish and
the Catholics; though what is left of it will do them no
injury, they still oppose this remnant with undiminished
violence, determined if possible to make us drain the last
drop in the cup of mortification and shame. It is not unnatural
that people should be indignant with a Government
whose egregious folly has got us into such an unhappy and
discreditable dilemma. We are in such a position that the
Roman Catholics and the Radicals are alone the gainers; and
accordingly, while all others are disturbed and terrified at
such a state of things, they are delighted, and confidently
expect their several ends and objects will be advanced by the
confusion, disunion, and discontent which prevail.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, March 18th.</i>&mdash;Everything still going on as bad
as possible. The Government is now so weak and powerless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
that its feebleness is openly talked of in Parliament, as well
as derided in the Press. A day or two ago we appeared to
be on the eve of an immediate crisis. Baillie gave notice of
a motion of censure on Torrington and Lord Grey, on which
John Russell declared he would not go on with the Budget or
any public business with this vote hanging over their heads
(which if carried involved resignation) nor till it was decided.
Last night Baillie withdrew it, and business will go on.
Nothing is more extraordinary than the conduct of many of
their friends, and the levity with which almost everybody
follows his own particular inclination or opinion, regardless
of the condition of the Government and of the grave questions
which are looming in the distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> SIR JAMES GRAHAM VACILLATES.</div>

<p>Of all strange and unaccountable things the conduct of
Graham is the strangest with reference to his ultimate
views, objects and expectations. On Lord Duncan's motion
about the Woods and Forests, he ostentatiously marched
out first to vote against them; on the Naval Estimates he
went away. All this exasperates and disgusts the Whigs,
with whom he looks forward hereafter to acting, and whose
chief he means to be. On Duncan's motion, John Russell's
brother-in-law, Romilly, voted against him; his nephew,
Hastings Russell, was in the House and did not vote.
Hayter told John Russell that when such men acted thus,
he could not ask independent members to come down and
support the Government. I called on Graham yesterday,
and found him in a state of great disgust at the Solicitor-General's
speech the night before, against the violence and
imprudence of which he bitterly inveighed. He said that
Stanley was preparing resolutions, and he had contemplated
having to fight the battle of religious liberty side by side
with John Russell, and the Government against them; but
that this speech perplexed him, and left him in doubt what
he ought to do or what he was to expect. Did John
Russell adopt all the furious 'No Popery' of his law officer,
and was he prepared to legislate in that sense? If so, he
would oppose him <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="with all his force">totis viribus</i>. I told him I did not believe
John Russell (who was not present) by any means concurred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
with Cockburn, whose speech he must only regard as an
individual effusion, singularly injudicious. He talked a
great deal about this and on other things. I asked him
why he had voted against the Government on Duncan's
motion, and told him that his doing so had greatly annoyed
them. He said they were to blame to fight such a bad case;
that he could not but vote with Duncan, having put his
name to an instrument, together with several other eminent
persons he named, recommending this very principle; and
that the Government ought to have shown more deference
for the opinion of Parliament and less condescension to the
Court, to please which this proposition had been resisted.
He ridiculed the argument of Parliamentary control being
useless and inefficient, as Seymour pretended. Moreover,
he said he had told Tufnell how he was going to vote. I
told him that as he contemplated at some future time the
dissolution of this Government, and its reconstruction with
a large Liberal infusion, including himself, a combination
devoutly to be desired, and as the great Whig party must
constitute the main strength of such a Government, it was
very desirable that he should avoid giving umbrage to them,
and exciting hostile feelings against himself as much as he
could and that I wished when he thought himself obliged
to oppose them, that he would tell them so fairly and
amicably. He might prevent many things being done, and
at all events it would obviate much of the bitterness that
otherwise was sure to arise, and that as he was now on
such good terms with John Russell he could very easily
do this, and could speak to him at any time. He said
he and John Russell were very good friends, but that all
the rest hated him. He had nothing to complain of on
the part of John Russell in the last transactions, but he
thought he had on that of the others, and he knew very
well they did not desire his junction with them, and were
very glad it had failed. And while he took the same view
that I do of the necessity of widening considerably the basis
of the Administration, and taking in men from the Liberal
ranks, he said nothing of the kind was contemplated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
other day. We had a great deal of talk, and I gathered
that the present state of his mind and opinions is this. He
thinks Stanley is ready to take the Government, but not
just yet; that he is prepared to push the Ministers later in
the Session, and drive them out; then to dissolve, and if
such a Parliament as he hopes and expects be returned, that
Palmerston will join him and lead the House of Commons,
Stratford Canning taking the Foreign Office (as he fancied)
till Palmerston joined. We parted, and I undertook to find
out for him what the Government really meant to do, and
whether they did intend strenuously to resist any attempt to
make the Anti-Papal Bill more stringent, and he promised
that he would communicate more frankly and freely with
John Russell in respect to any matters of difference, and
when he was disposed to take any adverse part.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 22nd.</i>&mdash;I told Labouchere what had passed between
Graham and me, and suggested to him to speak to John
Russell about it, which he said he would do; and this
morning I have a note from Lord John desiring me to call
on him. Labouchere told me that it was very true, that
most of his colleagues disliked and distrusted Graham, and
they all seem aware that his object is to see the Government
broken up, it being necessary that the old house should
be pulled down before the new one can be built in which he
intends to live. He told me, moreover, that half the Cabinet
were disposed to make up to the Protectionists, but that <i>he</i>
considered such policy equally false and discreditable. This
is very curious, however, and as I cannot doubt that
Palmerston is one of this half, it looks very much as if he
would join Stanley whenever circumstances permitted this
junction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. WALPOLE'S POSITION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>March 24th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning Graham called on me,
and said he heard his speech had greatly offended the
Ministerialists, he thought without reason; that he had
studiously avoided saying anything disagreeable to John
Russell, and had not touched on his letter or certain passages
in his first speech which might have provoked comment;
that he had stated his views and his case against the Bill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
very strongly as he was obliged to do. For having refused
to join the Government expressly and exclusively on account
of his invincible objections to this Bill, he was compelled to
show all the strength and force of these objections. He
then dilated afresh on the whole question, much as he had
done before. I told him that it was true they resented his
speech, which they characterised as one of bitter hostility
to the Government, and that it was so considered by some
who did not belong to the Government, such as Charles
Villiers, for example, and they coupled this with his previous
vote on Duncan's motion, and inferred that he was actuated
by a desire to do them all the mischief he could; besides
which they thought he was much to blame in certain topics
he had urged in reference to the possibility of an Irish
rebellion. I reminded him of what I had said to him the
other day, and of the bad impression he was making on the
minds of the Whigs, and how serious this was in reference
to the possibility of any future coalition.</p>

<p>He then talked in his usual way about Stanley and the
Government he is to form; said Walpole had made so good a
speech that it put him up very high, and would enable
Stanley to make him Secretary of State; and then he told
me of a sort of overture or feeler which Walpole had the
night before made to him. It was at the Speaker's <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levée</i>,
where they were conversing on the state of affairs and the
prospects of the country, when Walpole said, 'The only
thing would be for you and Lord Stanley to shut yourselves
up in a room together, when you might come to an understanding.'
Graham replied it was impossible; Lord Stanley
was a man of honour, who would abide by his pledges and
declarations; and he must, if he came into power, propose a
duty on corn. Walpole said if there was a majority against
it Stanley would give it up, and at all events it would only
be a duty for revenue, and not for protection. Graham
replied that was all nonsense. Let it be called what it
would, it was and was meant to be Protection; and in no
way and under no name would he ever be a party to any
duty whatever on foreign corn. Besides, there was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
Papal question. He opposed the Government Bill, and
Stanley and Walpole were prepared to carry legislation still
further; therefore these two important questions rendered
any understanding between him and Stanley impossible. I
told him I was going to John Russell, and that I was pretty
sure he had sent for me to talk to me about him.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I called on Lord John, and found him
in very good spirits and humour. It was as I expected, and
he said to me exactly what I had already said to Graham,
that since the conferences which had taken place, at which
time there was a general acquiescence (though with some a
reluctant one) in his joining the Government, circumstances
had very materially altered, and that his recent conduct had
produced so much irritation and estrangement that any
coalition with him for some time to come would be very
difficult. Time and other circumstances might again render
it possible, but now it was out of the question; this, it was
fit Graham should know, and as he did not like to say it to
him himself, he wished I would. I told him I was not surprised,
and that I had already said as much to him, and had
pointed out to him the inevitable consequences of the course
he had adopted. The truth is they, most of them, dislike
and fear him. They dread his propensity to truckle to the
Radicals and to popular clamour, above all as to economy;
and Lord John told me that Palmerston, who had urged him
at the close of the last Session to get Graham to join him,
had this year said he did not think he would be safe, for he
would probably insist on cutting down our establishments to
some dangerous extent. I told Lord John all I had said to
Graham about communicating with himself, and he said
that he personally felt no resentment towards him; he
acknowledged that he had not said anything offensive or
hostile to him personally, and that he should be very glad
to talk to him, particularly about the Budget, which was
not definitely settled, and he desired me to propose to
Graham to let him call on him for that purpose. This
ending did not correspond well to the beginning of the
communication I was to make to him, but I said I would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
tell him, which I shall do, softening the hard part as much
as I can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR JAMES GRAHAM AND THE WHIGS.</div>

<p>I afterwards called on Lord Lyndhurst, whom I found
very flourishing. Brougham was there, and they were
full of talk, chiefly about law, and agreeable enough. I
asked Lyndhurst what would happen, and he said he really
did not know from any communication he had had with
Stanley or anybody, but his belief was that Stanley was
prepared to take the Government, whenever the way was
made clear for him by the necessary money being voted,
and the Mutiny Bill passed. This is now the general
opinion.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>March 27th.</i>&mdash;On Monday I called on Graham, and
found John Russell had already been there. Graham was
dressing, and could not see him, but made an appointment to
call in Chesham Place at three o'clock. I told Graham, with
a good deal of <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="care">ménagememt</i>, what John Russell had said, and
I added as much as I could, in addition to what I had said
to him before about his relations with the Government. He
insisted that John Russell's people hated him, and he said
there were people about him who hated them; and then he
added that he could do nothing <i>alone</i>. I had little difficulty
in perceiving what is passing in his mind, and by what considerations
and with what views he is actuated. He thinks
he can rally round himself a body of supporters, of men who
will look up to him as a leader, and, by so doing, when there
is a break-up, he may play the part of a political potentate,
and, in the event of the construction of a Liberal Government,
that he may have a large share of influence, and make his
own terms. He knows or suspects that the Whigs want
nothing of him, but that he should singly join them to help
them out of their difficulties, thereby giving up altogether
any claim he might have to be a political leader, and all
distinctive character as such. This intention of theirs he
both resents and abhors, and though he is really anxious to
be on good terms with John Russell, with whom he wishes
hereafter to act, he can neither conceal his desire nor abstain
from his efforts to upset his Government. He is the strongest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
mixture of timidity and rashness I ever saw. He is generally
afraid of everything, and sees many unnecessary and imaginary
dangers; nevertheless, he is prepared to hazard almost
anything to bring about that consummation on which his
thoughts and his heart are fixed, but which can only be
worked out by the downfall of this, and the experiment of
a Stanley Government. He gave me to understand that it
was probable that those who opposed the second reading
of the Papal Bill would take no part in the Committee, and
leave the Government to be beaten there on the clauses, in
order to compel them to vote against the third reading of
their own Bill; and he would do this, although the effect
would be to leave the question unsettled, and to render
a terrific No-Popery agitation the principal ingredient of
a general election. His conduct and his views appear to me
greatly deficient in sagacity, and besides being mistaken and
mischievous, to be somewhat tortuous and insincere. One
thing is certain, that he has excited a strong sentiment of
disapprobation and distrust amongst all but the Radicals
and the Irish, who probably care very little for him, except so
far as he plays their game. While he is quite right in the
main on the Papal question and probably on some others
likewise, he pursues these particular objects at the expense
of sacrificing or endangering far greater, more important,
and more permanent interests.</p>

<p>The great debate terminated yesterday morning, after a
magnificent speech from Gladstone, and a very smart personal
attack of Disraeli on Graham, which was done with
his usual sarcastic power, and was very generally cheered.
As they left the House, Disraeli said to John Russell, 'I
could not help attacking your <i>Right Honourable friend</i>, but
I don't suppose you are very angry with me.' 'No,' he
replied, 'I am not angry with you, but you did not say anything
of which I have any reason whatever to complain.'
The debate was on the whole very able, but a preponderance
of argument on one side as great as the majority was on
the other. Roundell Palmer, Graham, Fox, and Gladstone
made admirable speeches; while, except Walpole's, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
was nothing very good on the other.  Disraeli did not
attempt to argue the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANCERY REFORM.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;Graham called on me on Sunday; said he
had had a most agreeable conversation with John Russell,
who was very friendly, and even confidential; in short,
Graham appeared in much better humour than before, and
he said he had engaged, and was resolved, to do all he
could to help them in the Budget. I asked him if he could
not do something with the Irish members, whose cause he
had espoused with so much gallantry and devotion, and he said
he thought he could, as he had a channel of communication
through Sir J. Young, and he would try. He then talked
of the Chancery measure, which would not do, and advised
that Lord John should consult Turner<a id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> about it, who thought
it was in the right line, though not the right thing, and that
with some alterations it might be made into a good measure.
Graham thought Stanley quite ready to take the Government,
and that Ceylon was the case on which he meant to give
them the mortal stab. But it remains to be seen whether
Torrington's successful defence of himself last night will not
defeat this scheme if it really existed. I told John Russell
what had passed between Graham and me about Turner.
This move of his about the Chancery Reform has been
another blunder. The measure is scouted, and the Government
do not themselves think it will do. I told Charles
Wood and John Russell that it would not. The former
replied, 'I don't think it will, but the House of Commons
must be taught that if good services are to be performed
they must be paid for;' and this was again Lord John's
notion, and he acknowledged to me that 'he supposed it
would not do.' He was going to see Pemberton Leigh, and
he told me afterwards he had seen him, and that he disapproved.
Why not have seen and consulted him before
producing his scheme instead of after? And why assume
that the House of Commons would be niggardly, instead
of framing the best measure they could, and casting on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
House of Commons the responsibility of refusing the necessary
funds to carry out a proper and desirable arrangement?
All this is miserable, bad management. The other night
Lyndhurst came out for the second time, and made an
attack on the Chancery scheme; very well done, marvellous
considering his age and his recent illness. The Chancellor
replied well enough, and Grey very unwisely spoke after
him. He is leading the Lords now that Lord Lansdowne
is away, but by no means with the same tact and discretion.</p>

<p>Torrington made his speech last night, and did it very
well, making a very favourable impression, and a good case
for himself. Nobody said anything, and all would have
ended there, and ended well, if Grey had not unwisely got
up and made a bitter speech against the Committee, and on
the case generally, in the course of which he said something
about martial law, and the Duke of Wellington's administration
of it in Spain; on which the old Duke rose in a fury,
and delivered a speech in a towering passion, which it would
have been far better for Torrington to have avoided. The
Duke was quite wrong, and Grey made a proper explanation,
but the incident was disagreeable.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 10th.</i>&mdash;At Newmarket on Sunday, and returned
yesterday. It was worth while to be there to see Stanley.
A few weeks ago he was on the point of being Prime Minister,
which only depended on himself. Then he stood up
in the House of Lords, and delivered an oration full of
gravity and dignity, such as became the man who had just
undertaken to form an Administration. A few days ago he
was feasted in Merchant Taylors' Hall, amidst a vast assembly
of lords and commoners, who all acknowledged him as their
chief. He was complimented amidst thunders of applause
upon his great and statesmanlike qualities, and he again
delivered an oration, serious as befitted the lofty capacity
in which he there appeared. If any of his vociferous disciples
and admirers, if some grave members of either House
of Parliament, or any distinguished foreigner who knew nothing
of Lord Stanley but what he saw, heard, or read of
him, could have suddenly found themselves in the betting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
room at Newmarket on Tuesday evening and seen Stanley
there, I think they would have been in a pretty state of
astonishment. There he was in the midst of a crowd of
blacklegs, betting men, and loose characters of every description,
in uproarious spirits, chaffing, rowing, and shouting
with laughter and joking. His amusement was to lay
Lord Glasgow a wager that he did not sneeze in a given
time, for which purpose he took pinch after pinch of snuff,
while Stanley jeered him and quizzed him with such noise that
he drew the whole mob around him to partake of the coarse
merriment he excited. It really was a sight and a wonder
to see any man playing such different parts, and I don't
suppose there is any other man who would act so naturally,
and obey all his impulses in such a way, utterly regardless of
appearances, and not caring what anybody might think of
the minister and the statesman so long as he could have
his fun.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>April 14th.</i>&mdash;Graham called on me yesterday. He
generally comes every Sunday now; talked gloomily about
everything, and seemed to think it very doubtful if the
Government would get through the Session. On Disraeli's
motion the other night,<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> on which there was only a majority
of thirteen, he said Gladstone had a great mind to vote
against them, and if he had, others of the Peelites would
have gone with him, and the Government would have been
in a minority; that Disraeli had managed his matters very
ill, and had made a very bad speech. If he had proposed
to apply the surplus to a partial reduction of the Malt Tax,
he would have put the Government in a great dilemma, and
they probably would have been defeated. I told him I did
not think he could have done this, or could have got a
majority on it, for nobody ever dreams of abolishing the
Malt Tax. He told me that Gladstone was disgusted with
the Government, and determined to turn them out if he
could, and from what he said of the disposition of the Peelites,
I infer that they are disposed to take Gladstone as their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
leader, and that they are animated with the same spirit of
hostility to the Government. Their views are these: they
think that when they have got the Government out, and
there shall have been a general election, Stanley will find
there is so small a majority for Protection, or none at all,
that he will give it up, and then Protection being abandoned,
that they may join him, and the old Conservative
party may be thus rallied and reunited. Such is the view
of Gladstone, and the Duke of Newcastle and Sidney Herbert
go along with him. Then as to the Papal Bill, he
returned to what he had before mentioned to me, the notion
of throwing all things into confusion in Committee; that
the Stanleyites will oppose the withdrawal of the clauses,
the opponents of the second reading take no part, the
Government be beaten, and then the Government and the
<i>Anti-Billites</i> together throw it out on the third reading. This
accomplished, he fancies there will be no more question of
any Bill whatever, that Stanley will give the go-by to legislation
by appointing a Committee, and so this great difficulty
will be got rid of. I would not listen to this fine
scheme, which involved a whole series of discreditable inconsistencies.
He and those who were opposed to penal
legislation refusing to assist in expunging those clauses of
the Bill which had such a character, for the chance of indirectly
getting rid of the whole, and Stanley's coming into
power and throwing over both Protection and Papal aggression,
after having fought his way to it upon nothing but
the assertion of these two principles. I urged him as
strongly as I could to be no party to any such schemes,
but to co-operate in getting this odious and mischievous
question settled and disposed of in the best and only way
that circumstances now admit of. He is evidently much
perplexed, conscious he is in a false position, and does not
see his way clearly as to the best course for him to adopt.
He said he was satisfied Stanley was determined not to
come into office if he could possibly avoid it, and could find
pretexts for refusing it; but his followers are so eager and
impatient, and he has led them on so far, that it is become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
difficult for him to avoid it if fresh opportunities present
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT EXHIBITION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 10th.</i>&mdash;On the day of the opening of the Great
Exhibition I went into the Park instead of the inside, being
satisfied with fine sights in the way of processions and
royal magnificence, and thinking it more interesting and
curious to see the masses and their behaviour. It was a
wonderful spectacle to see the countless multitudes, streaming
along in every direction, and congregated upon each
bank of the Serpentine down to the water's edge; no soldiers,
hardly any policemen to be seen, and yet all so orderly
and good-humoured. The success of everything was complete,
the joy and exultation of the Court unbounded.
The Queen wrote a touching letter to John Russell, full
of delight at the success of her husband's undertaking, and
at the warm reception which her subjects gave her. Since
that day all the world has been flocking to the Crystal
Palace, and we hear nothing but expressions of wonder and
admiration. The <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rebels">frondeurs</i> are all come round, and those
who abused it most vehemently now praise it as much.</p>

<p>Government has been again defeated in the House of
Commons, and the state of affairs is worse than ever.<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> The
apathy, indifference, and careless disposition of almost everybody
is as strange as it is disgusting. One cannot make out
what people want. The mass of the Protectionists know
what they want&mdash;to turn out the Government, get in themselves,
procure (as they expect) a majority on a dissolution,
and then restore Protection. Stanley is hanging back as much
as he can, evidently, and no wonder, shrinking from committing
himself to the desperate experiment of such an attempt;
but his eager followers push him on, and he has gone too
far with them now to hang back. Yet on the whole I think
the Government will still scramble through the Session, but
a scramble it is. John Russell made one of his very best
speeches the other night, in reply to Roebuck who urged
him to resign. But <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="he is not what he was">non est qualis erat</i>, he has committed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
great blunders and has been very neglectful. Tufnell told
me last night, he had observed for the last two years that
his personal influence was waning. There seems no doubt
that Protection has gained many advocates of late, and that
in the event of a dissolution most of the counties and the
agricultural boroughs will return Protectionists. It is therefore
probable that there may be a majority in favour of
some import duties, still it is not likely that the change
can be so great as to give more than a bare majority to a
Protectionist Government, and such men with such a majority
can hardly hope to succeed in reversing the whole of
our commercial policy and restoring the old system. But
the contest will be very alarming, and nobody can tell what
will come out of the new Reform Bill, and above all out
of the restless spirit of change and progress which has
been put in motion. I cannot help fearing that we are approaching
times of difficulty and danger, the more difficult
and dangerous from the lack of statesmen who have either
capacity to deal with political exigencies, or who possess
the confidence and regard of the country sufficiently to be
enabled to take the conduct of affairs into their own hands,
who will be followed, listened to, and obeyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. THIERS IN LONDON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>May 31st.</i>&mdash;I have been too much occupied, even absorbed,
by my Derby concerns to trouble myself about
anything else, but I have at least been occupied to some
purpose, for I won the largest sum I ever did win in any
race, the greatest part of which I have received, and no
doubt shall receive the whole. Meanwhile the world seems
to have thought of nothing but the Exhibition, and all
politics have appeared flat, stale, and unprofitable. This
has turned to the advantage of the Government, who after
weathering other storms were finally set on their legs by
the excellent division they got on Baillie's motion about
Ceylon. Everybody now admits that they are quite safe
for this Session, after which we shall see; but though they
are considered, and really are, a weak Government, their
weakness is strength compared with that of the other party,
which is hopelessly distracted and disorganised. They have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
no unity of purpose, object, or opinion, no reliance on their
leaders; there is no mutual confidence and esteem amongst
them; and their great man, Stanley, has been all along
making game of them, humbugging them and laughing in
his sleeve. He has never really intended to turn out the
Government, nor to take office himself, and his whole
object has been to pretend to aim at both these things,
taking all the time especial care to avoid being successful.
I am now told that they are beginning to open their eyes
to what has long been obvious to all cool observers. All
this could hardly be otherwise; Stanley could not fail to be
disgusted with a party which suffers itself to be in great
measure represented by such men as G. F. Young and
Ferrand.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>June 8th.</i>&mdash;I broke off what I was writing to go to Ascot.
There is a picture in 'Punch' of the shipwrecked Government
saved by the 'Exhibition' steamer, which really is historically
true, thanks in great measure to the attractions
of the Exhibition, which have acted upon the public as
well as upon Parliament. The attacks upon the Government
have for some time past become so languid, and there
has been so much indifference and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="a lack of concern">insouciance</i> about politics
and parties, that John Russell and his Cabinet have
been relieved from all present danger. The cause of Protection
gets weaker every day; all sensible and practical
men give it up as hopeless; nevertheless that party will
make a desperate struggle when the elections take place,
and though they will infallibly fail in bringing back Protection,
they will probably have success enough to make
government if possible more difficult than it is now.</p>

<p>M. Thiers has just been over here for a week. He came
to see the Exhibition, and was lodged at Ellice's house.
He was indefatigable while he was here, excessively amused
and happy, and is gone back enchanted at his reception in
the world, and full of admiration of all he saw. He was
met by great and general cordiality, invited everywhere,
had long conversations with Palmerston, John Russell, and
Aberdeen, dined with Disraeli to meet Stanley, who, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
did not come, and he was the only conspicuous man
he missed seeing. He was presented to the Queen at the
Exhibition. Hearing he was there (for he usually went
early every morning like herself) she sent for him, was very
gracious, and both she and the Prince talked to him a good
while. He talked very conservative language while he was
here, and did not abuse anybody.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;Politics are stagnant; the Government has had
no difficulties, and they are gliding through the Session with
an ease and safety which was not promised at the beginning
of it. Their enemies have done more for them than their
friends. Lord Derby's death has taken Stanley out of the
field for a time. Disraeli made a foolish motion and a bad
speech. Government had a good majority; nobody took
the least interest in the proceeding. Protection falls lower
and lower and becomes every day more obviously hopeless;
and this really is about all there is to say. The great
question of Law Reform seems to have a chance of being
taken up in earnest; the new Government Bill is rather
popular, and has been well received, and there appears to be
something like a stir in the public mind and a disposition
to insist on an attempt being made to cleanse this Augean
stable. The question that most interests the public is that
of the retention or removal of the Crystal Palace. Curiously
enough, the Prince, whose child it is, and who was so earnestly
bent on keeping it in existence, has now turned round,
and is for demolishing it.</p>

<p>The Anti-Papal Bill passed the other night, Thesiger
having succeeded in getting in some amendments, apparently
making it more efficient and stringent; but I don't believe,
though they had better not be there, that it will make any
difference. While it was receiving its finishing touches in
the Commons, another rescript of the Pope made its appearance
with a fresh creation of Bishops in England! The
opponents of the Bill had intended to make one more grand
display (Gladstone especially) on the third reading; but by
some blundering or negligence they lost the opportunity.
Gladstone made a short but good speech as it was.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO THE GROVE.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, July 25th.</i>&mdash;I have had nothing to say for some
weeks past. I went to Liverpool for the races; stayed there
to assist at a great <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="celebration">fête</i> given by Mr. Brown, M.P. for Lancashire,
on board the 'Atlantic,' to the Exhibition Commissioners
and foreigners. The 'Atlantic' is magnificent, fitted
up like a luxurious house, all painting, gilding, silk and
velvet, and with every sort of comfort. I went all about the
river and the docks. Foreigners are much struck with all
they saw, there and elsewhere. Thence I started on an
expedition to the lakes, got to Bowness, found nothing but
torrents of rain, a hurricane of wind, cold and discomfort;
so came back to town after taking a look at Windermere,
without going on to Derwentwater and Ullswater, as I had
intended. I found London expiring, and the Session drawing
to a close; Government safe if not sound; two election
defeats, Knaresborough and Scarborough, have a bad aspect;
John Russell is mortified at the last and disgusted with
Londesborough, whom he made a Peer, and whose agents
took active part in favour of G. F. Young. The Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill has passed the Lords by an enormous
majority, after a tolerable debate. Brougham and Derby
both absent. The Jews are again defeated, and kicking and
plunging in the House of Commons, and going to try their
case in a Court of Law. They will not take the oath as it
stands, which I would do if I were a Jew. They have so far
committed themselves against that course, that they perhaps
cannot now take it without inconsistency and dishonour;
but it would have been their best course if they had thought
of it at first. As it is, the Lords will not give way, but it
is an awkward question to have continually agitated. I
have not seen Graham for many weeks, but John Russell
told me he had been acting a very friendly part.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>The Grove, September 7th.</i>&mdash;After four years' absence
during Clarendon's viceroyalty I find myself here again, glad
to revisit a place where I have passed so much agreeable
time, glad to be in my old room, and look upon the pictures,
which are like old and familiar acquaintances. My journalising
has grown very slack; instead of one book in three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
months or four, I have written half a book in six. I had
contemplated a summary of the Session, but abandoned it in
disgust, and I have never met with anybody or heard anything
sufficient to rouse me from my idleness and indifference
for weeks or even months past. I did indeed breakfast at
Grote's one morning to meet Léon Faucher, the French
Minister of the Interior, and had some talk with him about
French politics, from which I brought away nothing particular
except his defence of centralisation, and his confident
prediction that Louis Napoleon would be re-elected. I have
myself been so occupied with racing, at which I have been
generally successful, that I have hardly thought of politics.
For a long time I had not seen Graham. The Duke of
Bedford and I have ceased to correspond, and we seldom
meet, so that my sources of political information have been
nearly dried up. One day, however, not long ago, the Duke
of Bedford came to me and told me that Lord John had a
great disposition to invite Graham to join the Cabinet, and
asked me what I thought of it. I said that I was against
it, and thought he had better strengthen his Government by
his own friends; that a Cabinet could only become stronger
by the accession of persons who would be well received, and
between whom and those they joined there would be feelings
of cordiality and mutual confidence, which would not be the
case between Graham and the Whigs; that they disliked him,
and had no mind to have him; while he was not only aware
of, but exaggerated, their repugnance and dislike of him.
The Duke said he took the same view that I did, and should
tell Lord John so. Some time after, about a fortnight ago,
he came to me again, and said Lord John had made up his
mind to make an overture to Graham, had broached it to
the Cabinet, who had consented, that others were to be
invited with him, but it was not settled who. Some were for
Gladstone, some for Newcastle, almost all for Cardwell; but
what he had particularly to say to me was this, that Lord
John felt the difficulty and delicacy of this intended negotiation
with Graham; that he should not like to make an offer
to be refused; and as much discussion would be necessary he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
wished it to be carried on through me, and that I should
undertake to make the overtures. I said that I should of
course be ready to do anything Lord John wished in the
matter, and I suppose it will end in my having to undertake
the negotiation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GEORGE LEWIS'S MISSION TO NETHERBY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>September 23rd.</i>&mdash;At the Grove on Saturday last, where
I heard, with some surprise, that George Lewis had been
sent to Netherby a day or two before with John Russell's
proposals to Graham. He took a memorandum with a
frank and friendly offer, but I was quite sure it would
not be accepted, when I learnt that it was the Board of
Control for himself, and the Under Secretaryship of the
Colonies for Frederic Peel. He was informed that all the
Cabinet concurred in the offer, and wished him to join them;
and their idea was, that if he was not indisposed, the Office
would not signify, besides that the India Board would be
important nest year, when the Charter of the East India
Company had to be renewed. As Graham had said he had
no connexions, and the only man he cared about was Frederick
Peel, they offered him this office in place of Hawes,
which would be of consequence, as he would have to do all
the House of Commons work. It seems George Lewis himself
did not expect this offer would be accepted, nor did
Clarendon, who told me this when I got to the Grove on
Saturday. Accordingly, the next morning, Sunday, a letter
arrived from George Lewis to his wife, informing her that
Graham had declined, and this is all I have as yet heard
about it.</p>

<p>I went last week to Hickleton Hall for Doncaster Races,
but there was nobody there, and I had little or no conversation
with Charles Wood. Lady Mary spoke to me about John
Russell, and lamented that he was so careless and indifferent
in his relations with the Court, exhibiting such a contrast
to Sir Robert Peel, who was so full of zeal and attention,
and ready on all occasions to give the Queen advice and
assistance in whatever way she might require it. This
was  <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="in regard to">à propos</i> of their having asked him for his opinion and
advice on some matter, when he sent no answer at all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
She thought very justly that this was impolitic as well as
wrong.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>September 27th.</i>&mdash;George Lewis called on me the other day,
and told me all that passed between Graham and himself.
He had written to him previously, saying he had a message
to deliver from John Russell, and asking him to receive
it at Netherby. They met at Carlisle, and George Lewis
says he is sure Graham guessed the purport of his visit, and
had already made up his mind to decline. He proposed
forthwith to open the matter to him, but Graham would not
let him, and said, 'We will talk of business to-morrow.' He
evidently shirked the subject, evinced no curiosity to hear
his errand, and tried to put off the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="clarification">éclaircissement</i>. The next
day after breakfast Graham proposed a walk, when George
Lewis opened the business, saying he was sent to ask him to
join the Government. Graham immediately began to make
all sorts of objections, talked of various matters and made
many criticisms, and said it was out of the question. Lewis
argued the point with him, without making any impression,
and at last said, 'Well, but you had better let me tell you
what the offer is.' Graham replied he did not want to hear
it, and it was better he should not tell him. The other insisted,
saying he should not have fulfilled his mission unless
he communicated the offer, when Graham agreed to hear it.
Lewis says he thinks he was rather pleased than otherwise
with the offer, particularly with that part of it which concerned
Frederic Peel. He said this was a very advantageous
offer to him. However, it made no difference, and ultimately
he came away, bringing with him a memorandum for
John Russell which Graham wrote, setting forth the reasons
of his refusal. I was not sorry to hear that on the subject
of reform he was an alarmist, and only afraid lest Lord John
should go too far. So ends this negotiation, and I am glad
that Lewis was sent instead of myself upon so abortive a
mission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KOSSUTH'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>October 10th.</i>&mdash;Lord Granville returned to England a
few days ago, when I told him what had passed about
Graham. He told me that he had known what had taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
place on the subject some time ago, when the resistance in
the Cabinet to his being invited was so great that it was
given up. The man most against it was Palmerston, and
he wanted offers to be made to Gladstone instead. If Graham
had known this, it would have served to improve his disposition
to decline the offer.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, November 8th.</i>&mdash;I was not aware till I opened this
book that a month had elapsed since I had written a line in
it. At Newmarket I seldom hear or think of politics, but
this time an incident occurred in which I took a part, and
which was very near leading to serious consequences. About
three weeks ago Kossuth arrived in England, and was received
at Southampton and Winchester with prodigious demonstrations
and a great uproar on the part of Mayors and Corporations,
the rabble and a sprinkling of Radicals, of whom
the most conspicuous were Cobden and Dudley Stuart.
While Kossuth was still at Southampton, but about to
proceed to London, on Monday, October 24th, I received
a letter from my brother Henry, informing me that he had
just received information that Palmerston was going to receive
Kossuth, and he entreated me, if I had any influence
with the Government, to try and prevent such an outrage,
and that he believed if it was done Buol would be recalled.
I could not doubt that the information from such a quarter
was correct, and it was confirmed by a notice in one of the
pro-Kossuth papers, that Lord Palmerston was going to receive
Mr. Kossuth 'privately and unofficially.' Thinking
that it would be an outrage, and one in all probability attended
with serious consequences, I resolved to write to
John Russell at once. I sent him a copy of my brother's
letter, only putting the names in blank, said that the authority
on which this was notified to me compelled me to
attend to it, and added, 'I send you this without comment;
you will deal with it as you think fit, "<span class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="I have freed my soul">liberavi animam
meam</span>."' The result of this communication was that Lord
John Russell addressed a remonstrance to Lord Palmerston.
Lord Palmerston replied with his usual audacity that 'he
would not be dictated to and should receive whomsoever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
he pleased in his own house, but that his office was at the
disposal of the Government.' On receiving this answer
Lord John instantly summoned a Cabinet and laid it before
them. Ministers were of opinion (all but one) that Lord
Palmerston should not receive Kossuth, and he accordingly
submitted to the decision of his colleagues.</p>

<p>They are in great perplexity about this new measure of
Reform, and how to concoct it. Lord John, who hates details,
and the collection and examination of statistics, chose
to entrust the first consideration of it to a Committee of the
Cabinet, consisting of Minto, Carlisle, and Charles Wood.
The first two are strange men to appoint, and the whole
business was in fact committed to Wood. He undertook to
collect the necessary statistics, and he began by expressing
an opinion that they should commence the work by disfranchisement,
get rid of such small boroughs as still remained&mdash;a
new Schedule A. This the Duke of Bedford
strongly combated. Since that Charles Wood says the
more he goes into the matter the more difficulty he finds.
He is, however, to lay his statistics before Lord John, and it
will probably end in the latter concocting some scheme.
There have been reports rife of dissensions in the Cabinet
about Reform, which is quite untrue, as no discussion has
yet taken place. I told Lord Lansdowne that many people
were alarmed at the prospect of a new Reform Bill, but still
relied upon him, and considered his being in the Cabinet a
guarantee that no strong measure would be proposed. He
replied, 'They may rely with entire confidence on me, for
you may be sure that if any strong measure was to be contemplated
by the Cabinet, I should immediately walk out
of it.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON AND KOSSUTH.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>November 16th.</i>&mdash;I was at Windsor for a Council on
Friday. There I saw Palmerston and Lord John mighty
merry and cordial, talking and laughing together. Those
breezes leave nothing behind, particularly with Palmerston,
who never loses his temper, and treats everything with gaiety
and levity. The Queen is vastly displeased with the Kossuth
demonstrations, especially at seeing him received at Manchester
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
with as much enthusiasm as attended her own visit
to that place. The numbers and the noise that have hailed
Kossuth have certainly been curious, but not one individual
of station or consideration has gone near him, which cannot
fail to mortify him deeply. Delane is just come from Vienna,
where he had a long interview with Schwarzenberg, who
treated, or at least affected to do so, the Kossuth reception
with contempt and indifference.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 22nd.</i>&mdash;At Brocket on Tuesday and Wednesday
last. I found Beauvale knew all about the Palmerston
and Kossuth affair, and was of course mightily pleased
at his brother-in-law's defeat, and at the interview not
having taken place. But on Wednesday afternoon we were
both of us astounded at reading in the paper the account
of the deputation to Palmerston, the addresses and his
answers.<a id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
We both agreed that he had only <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="drawn back in order to make a better jump">reculé pour mieux
sauter</i>, and that what he had now done was a great deal
worse and more offensive than if he had received Kossuth.
The breach of faith and the defiance towards John Russell
and his colleagues are flagrant, and the whole affair astonishing
even in him who has done such things that nothing
ought to astonish me. I am waiting with the greatest
curiosity to see what John Russell will do, and how he will
take it, and how it will be taken by the Queen and the
foreign Courts and Ministers. To receive an address in
which the Emperors of Russia and Austria are called despots,
tyrants, and odious assassins, and to express great gratification
at it, is an unparalleled outrage, and when to this is
added a speech breathing Radical sentiments and interference,
it is difficult to believe that the whole thing can pass
off without notice. But I have seen such repeated instances
of lukewarmness and pusillanimous submission to Palmerston
that I have little or no expectation of his colleagues
taking it up seriously; and if they do stir in the matter Palmerston,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
with his usual mixture of effrontery and adroitness,
will contrive to pacify them and get rid of the whole thing,
and then go on as before. I think, however, this is on
the whole the worst thing he has ever done. The public do
not know how bad it is, because they do not know what
had previously passed in the Cabinet, and its consequences.
In the great squabbles on the Syrian question, and again on
the Greek, he had a great advantage because they were all
committed with him and could not consistently go against
him, but this is a very different affair in all its bearings.
The ostentatious bidding for Radical favour and the flattery
of the democracy, of which his speeches were full, are disgusting
in themselves and full of danger. It is evident that he
has seized the opportunity of the Kossuth demonstrations to
associate himself with them, and convert the popular excitement
into political capital for himself. He thinks to make
himself too formidable, by having the masses at his back, for
his colleagues to dare to quarrel with him, and by this
audacious defiance of them he intends to make himself once
for all master of the situation. If they endure this tamely
he will be their master, and henceforward they must do his
bidding, be it what it may.<a id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DISRAELI'S 'LIFE OF LORD GEORGE BENTINCK.'</div>

<p>Kossuth is at last gone, but promising to return in a few
weeks, and openly announcing that he does so for the
purpose of stirring up war against Austria, and a great
democratic movement for the liberation of Hungary and all
other countries under absolute Governments, in which he
expects England to take a conspicuous part; and his last
injunction and entreaty to his friends is to agitate for this
purpose. His last speech is by far the most open and significant
that he has delivered, and exhibits his confidence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
well or ill founded, in the progress he has made. That he
is very able, and especially a great speaker, cannot be denied;
but I take it that a more hypocritical, unscrupulous, mischievous
adventurer never existed. His speeches here have
been very clever, but I derive a higher idea of his oratorical
power from a speech, reported in the 'Times' on Wednesday
last, which he made in the Hungarian Diet upon the question
of employing Hungarian troops in Italy, which was admirable,
and reminded me of Plunket in lucidity and closeness
of reasoning.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>November 24th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning Disraeli called on me
to speak to me about his work, 'The Life of George Bentinck,'
which he has written and is just going to bring out.
I read him a part of my sketch of his character. I found
that he meant to confine it to his political career of the last
three years of his existence, and to keep clear of racing and
all his antecedent life. He seems to have formed a very just
conception of him, having, however, seen the best of him,
and therefore taking a more favourable view of his character
than I, who knew him longer and better, could do. I asked
him, supposing George Bentinck had lived, what he thought
he would have done, and how he would have succeeded as a
Minister and Leader of a Government in the House of Commons
if his party had come in. He said he would have
failed. There were, besides, the defects of his education and
want of flexibility in his character. In his speaking there
were physical defects he never could have got over, and as it
had been proved that he could not lead an Opposition, still
less would he have been able to lead a Government. He
said, what is very true, that he had not a particle of conceit;
he was very obstinate, but had no vanity. Disraeli thinks
Henry Bentinck very clever too. He told me his book was
to contain a character of Peel which had never been described.
I asked him if he would like to see what I had written about
him. Very much, he said, so I gave it to him.</p>

<p>I find there are not two opinions about Palmerston's conduct,
and those who think so are ignorant how bad it is, because
they know nothing of what passed between Lord John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
and him. I have had two long letters from Graham all about
Palmerston and the new Reform Bill. With regard to the
latter he is full of gloomy apprehensions, and seems in a
state of contradiction with himself, desperately afraid lest
John Russell should go too far, and equally afraid he should
not go far enough. With all his ability he is a most strange
and inconsistent politician. It is impossible to know what
he will do, and I suspect he does not know himself. He
writes to me one day full of alarm lest the Queen's Speech
should contain anything binding the Government to go considerable
lengths, and expressing strong hopes that the
Court will resist any proposal of the sort. The next day
he says, unless they disfranchise I know not how many
boroughs, they will give no satisfaction, be deserted by the
Radicals, and he is not at all sure that the Conservatives will
support them; in short, his fears assume the most different
shapes, and it is pretty clear that whatever the Government
proposes he will find fault with their plan.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 2nd.</i>&mdash;I was at the Grange last week from
Wednesday to Saturday. There I met Walewski, who
talked to me a great deal about Palmerston, whose character
he seems to understand pretty well. He said that nothing
could be more <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="pleasant">aimable</i> than he was to him personally, or
more civil and obliging in their intercourse, but from the
experience he had already had of him he was convinced that,
if France got over her present difficulties and acquired a
settled and permanent Government, so as to be able to attend
to foreign affairs, in which her domestic troubles now prevented
her from exercising any influence, six months would
not elapse without a quarrel of some sort taking place between
the two Governments. He then spoke of his interference,
his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="processes">procédés</i>, and his invincible obstinacy, which
made it impossible to make any impression on him, and he
told me of two recent cases, one regarding Greece, the other
Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON'S CLAIMS ON NAPLES.</div>

<p>It seems that many months ago Wyse wrote an account
to Palmerston of the frightful brigandage that was going on
in Greece, not, however, pretending that there was any complaint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
to make on the part of British subjects. On this
Palmerston wrote a despatch in his usual style of objurgation,
bitterly reproaching the Greek Government for not putting
the brigandage down. The Greek Government, angry and
frightened, appealed to the French and the Russian Ministers,
from whom of course they received sympathy and comfort,
and recently the Greek Minister has sent 'a very strong
answer.' This fresh squabble is probably by no means distasteful
to either the French or Russian Governments, particularly
the latter, and will have the effect of throwing
Greece into the arms of the Emperor. I do not know what
the political effect of such dependence may be, nor how
British interests may be affected by it, but this result is
almost inevitable, and, whatever the consequences may be, is
owing to Palmerston's violence.</p>

<p>The case of Sicily is eminently characteristic. During
the troubles in '48 a destruction occurred of the property of
English and other foreigners, both at Naples and in Sicily,
for which their respective Governments required an indemnity.
A Commission was appointed, consisting of the French,
Austrian, and English Ministers, and I think the Russian.
All the claims were laboriously investigated, and after above
a year of enquiry, the Commissioners came to a decision,
and allotted the amount of compensation they thought due,
which was to be paid in inscriptions in the Grand Livre or
Neapolitan funds. This award was regularly drawn up and
signed by Sir William Temple. It was sent home, when,
after some delay, Palmerston sent it back and said the money
was not enough, and he arbitrarily fixed a higher sum to be
given to the English. Of this the Neapolitan Government
bitterly complained, and the other Commissioners considered
it unwarrantable and unfair. After a great deal of remonstrance
and discussion, Palmerston proving inexorable, the
Neapolitans gave way. They then considered the affair
settled; but not at all. Palmerston then sent it back again,
and said the allotted sum should not be paid in stock, but
in money. Walewski told me this as I have written it down.
In the course of the dispute he arrived here, and very soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
had to discuss the matter with Palmerston. He represented
to him that the English claims had already been treated with
peculiar favour and a very large indemnity granted, that
Temple was quite satisfied, and had subscribed to the award,
and he pointed out the injustice of fresh demands being
superadded from hence. He had a conversation of two hours
with Palmerston, who listened with great politeness, appeared
struck by Walewski's representations, and ended by
saying, 'Well, I will write to Temple about it.' Walewski
went away, fancying he had produced a great effect, and that
Palmerston was going to write to Temple to relax the rigour
of his exactions; but he did not then know his man, and
was only undeceived when he found afterwards that he had
written to Temple, but only to desire him to press his demands,
and exact a concession to them to the uttermost
farthing.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 3rd.</i>&mdash;At twelve o'clock yesterday morning the
wonderful Electric Telegraph brought us word that two
hours before the President had accomplished his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup d'État</i>
at Paris with success. Everybody expected it would happen,
nobody that it would happen so soon. Madame de Lieven
wrote to Beauvale on Sunday, giving him an account of the
efforts that were making by the Moderates, Guizot at the
head of them, to bring about a reconciliation and compromise
with the President, and auguring success. She says, '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Many people claim that while seeming to lend himself to it, the President does not want this; a Coup d'état would suit him better.  He is ready for it, the army is for him, so is the country.">Beaucoup
de personnes prétendent que tout en ayant l'air de s'y
prêter, le Président n'a pas grande envie de ce moyen; un
Coup d'État le ferait mieux arriver: il s'y est tout préparé,
la troupe est à lui, le pays aussi.</span>' She little thought that
in twenty-four hours the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup d'État</i> <span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="was going to burst">'allait éclater</span>,' and
that all was in preparation for it, while he was amusing the
Burgraves and Moderates with negotiations and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="negotiations">pourparlers</i>,
in which he was never serious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COUP D'ÉTAT IN PARIS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Panshanger, December 14th.</i>&mdash;Naturally the French Revolution
has absorbed all interest. The success of Louis
Napoleon's <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup d'État</i> has been complete, and his audacity
and unscrupulousness marvellous. The French are indeed a
strange people, so restless, fierce, and excitable that they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
ready to upset governments with the smallest possible show
of reason or necessity&mdash;with cause as in 1830, or without
cause as in 1848&mdash;and they acquiesce without a struggle,
and tamely endure the impudent and vulgar democratic rule
of the blackguards and mountebanks of the Provisional
Government at the latter period, and now the unlimited and
severe military despotism of Louis Napoleon. The Press in
this country has generally inveighed with great indignation
against him, very much overdoing the case. Society in
general is in a rather neutral state. Few can approve of his
very violent measures and arbitrary acts, but on the other
hand there was such a general feeling of contempt for the
Constitution, and of disgust at the conduct of the Assembly
and the parties which divided it, that nobody lamented their
overthrow, or regarded with the slightest interest or compassion
the leaders who have been so brutally and ignominiously
treated. Everybody rejoices at the misfortunes of
Thiers, who is universally regarded as the evil genius of
France and the greatest maker of mischief who ever played
a part on the stage of politics. Flahault, who has been
the agent and confidant of the President, writes word that
he has saved France, and it is the object of his adherents
to make the world believe that his measures were rendered
necessary by a Socialist plot, which he has saved the country
by putting down; and besides this we hear of an Orleanist
plot, and of the violence the Assembly was about to have
recourse to against him, if he had not anticipated them.
These seem to be, and probably are, mere pretences, got
up to cover his violence with something plausible, and
which the world may swallow; the truth being that he
prepared all that he has done with singular boldness, secrecy
adroitness, and success, amusing his enemies with the semblance
of negotiations which he never meant sincerely to
carry out to an end, and relying (as it has turned out that
he could do) upon the Army, by whose aid he has taken all
power into his own hands. Having done so, he resolved to
do nothing by halves, and certainly by the prompt, peremptory,
and arbitrary measures he adopted he has secured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
present success, given confidence as to the stability of his
Government, raised his own reputation for energy and ability,
and in all probability has prevented a great amount of disorder
and bloodshed, which would have taken place if his
success had been less complete than it was.

Budget.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, December 19th, 1851.</i>&mdash;Mr. Disraeli has sent me
his book, the 'Life of Lord George Bentinck,' which, though
principally recording very dry Parliamentary debates, he has
managed to make very readable. He does ample justice to
his hero, but I think without exaggeration; and he certainly
makes him out to have been a very remarkable man, with
great ability and a superhuman power of work. It is the
more extraordinary because for above forty years George
Bentinck was indolent, and addicted to none but frivolous
pursuits, though he always pursued his pleasurable occupations
in a business-like and laborious manner. The character
of Peel in this book is curious, but I do not think it is unfair,
and it is in a becoming spirit of seriousness and even respect,
fully acknowledging his great qualities, but freely criticising
his character and his career. The Jewish episode is amusing,
and I like it for its courage.</p>

<p>Something, but I know not what, has happened about
Palmerston. This will be no quarrel with Austria, because
Buol has dined with Palmerston, and the Emperor has, at
last, received Westmorland;<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> but the Duke of Bedford,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
who is by turns confidential and mysterious, and who delights
in raising my curiosity and then not satisfying it, has written
to me thus. After a good deal about Lord John's defending
Palmerston and his not approving his conduct, in one strain
one day and another the next, the Duke said there had been
a correspondence between them on the subject, which he was
to see. He never said more about it, and to a question I
put to him thereon he sent no answer. In another letter I
alluded to this, but added that it did not now much signify,
on which he writes: 'You attach no importance to the
correspondence I told you of, and do not now care to know
about it, but if I am not mistaken you will ere long change
your opinion.'</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, December 22nd.</i>&mdash;A Cabinet has been suddenly
called to-day, which is about the matter the Duke alluded to.</p>

<p>I met Disraeli and told him what I thought of his book.
It is difficult to know what he is at, for, although he knows
my opinion of George Bentinck and of Peel and of Free
Trade, he nevertheless wanted me to review his book in the
'Times,' and he made a sort of indirect overture to me for
the purpose. Of course I said it was out of the question.
Graham is very indignant with Disraeli, and treats his character
of Peel as a great and malignant outrage. In my
opinion he is quite wrong. I sent him my own sketch, which
he says is in a more kindly spirit; but he is evidently not
satisfied with it. He tells me one curious anecdote, if it
be true. I have criticised Peel's conduct about the East
Retford franchise just before the Reform Bill, and said he
ought to have gone with Huskisson. Graham says that he
wished to do <i>more</i> than Huskisson; that Peel in the Cabinet
supported the more Liberal measure, but was overruled,
and he yielded to the opinion of the majority, whereas
Huskisson took the other side in the Cabinet, but got
frightened afterwards, and supported in the House of
Commons what he had opposed in the Cabinet. If this be
true, it was very disgraceful of Huskisson, but it does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
exonerate Peel. On the contrary, I think it makes his case
worse. He clearly ought to have resigned rather than take
the course he did, if such were his opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MR. LUTTRELL.</div>

<p>On Friday last Mr. Luttrell died, at the age of eighty-one,
having been long ill and confined to his bed with great
suffering. When I first came into the world, nearly forty
years ago, he was one of the most brilliant members of
society, celebrated for his wit and repartee, and for many years
we lived in great intimacy and in the same society. He was
the natural son of old Lord Carhampton, but was always on
bad terms with his father. He had been a member of the Irish
Parliament, and obtained a place, afterwards commuted for
a pension, on which he lived. He never took any part in
public life, was always in narrow circumstances, and had
the air, and I think the feeling, of a disappointed man. He
was, in fact, conscious of powers which ought to have raised
him to a higher place than that which he occupied in the
world. Why he never did advance, whether it was from
pride and shyness, or from disinclination, or the unkind
neglect of those who might have helped him on, I know
not. As it was, he never had any but a social position, but
that was one of great eminence and success. He was looked
upon as one of the most accomplished, agreeable, and entertaining
men of his day; he lived in the very best society,
was one of the cherished and favoured <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="regulars">habitués</i> of Holland
House, and the intimate friend and associate of Sydney
Smith, Rogers, Lord Dudley, and all the men most distinguished
in politics, literature, or social eminence. Rogers
and Luttrell especially were always bracketed together, intimate
friends, seldom apart, and always hating, abusing,
and ridiculing each other. Luttrell's <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="witticisms">bons mots</i> and repartees
were excellent, but he was less caustic, more good-natured,
but in some respects less striking in conversation, than his
companion, who had more knowledge, more imagination,
and, though in a different way, as much wit. His literary
performances were few and far between, consisting of little
more than occasional verses, and 'Crockford House,' an
amusing but rather flimsy satire. His contribution to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
pleasures of society was in talk, and he was too idle and too
much of a Sybarite to devote himself to any grave and
laborious pursuit. There are, however, so many more good
writers than good talkers, and the two qualities are so rarely
found united in the same person, that we owe a debt of
gratitude to Luttrell for having cultivated his conversational
rather than his literary powers, and for having adorned and
delighted society for so many years with his remarkable
vivacity and wit. It used to be said that he was less
amusing, though in the same style, as his father; but of
this I cannot judge, as I do not remember Lord Carhampton.
Luttrell had excellent qualities, was an honourable, high-minded
gentleman, true and sincere, grateful for kindness
and attentions without being punctilious or exacting, full of
good feelings and warm affections, a man of excellent sense,
a philosopher in all things, and especially in religion. For
several years past he had disappeared from the world, and
lived in great retirement, suffering under much bad health
and bodily pain, but cheerful and in possession of his faculties
nearly to the last. His death has removed one of the last
survivors of a brilliant generation, a conspicuous member of
such a society as the world has rarely seen, nothing approaching
to which exists at present, and such as perhaps it will
never see again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FALL OF LORD PALMERSTON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>December 23rd.</i>&mdash;<i>Palmerston is out!</i>&mdash;actually, really, and
irretrievably out. I nearly dropped off my chair yesterday
afternoon, when at five o'clock, a few moments after the
Cabinet had broken up, Granville rushed into my room and
said, 'It is none of the things we talked over; Pam is out,
the offer of the Foreign Office goes to Clarendon to-night,
and if he refuses, which of course he will not, it is to be
offered to me!!' Well might the Duke of Bedford say I
should 'change my opinion,' and soon think this correspondence
did signify, for it was on the matter which led to the
fall of Palmerston. Granville came to town on Saturday,
not knowing (as none of the Ministers did) what the Cabinet
was about. On Sunday he received a note from John
Russell, begging him not to come to it, and telling him he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
would afterwards inform him why. This of course surprised
him, but after going about amongst such of his colleagues as
were here, he arrived at the conclusion that the matter related
to foreign affairs, that Normanby was to be recalled,
and the Paris Embassy offered to him, or that he was to be
sent to Paris on a special mission. We discussed these contingencies
together with all other changes of office which
occurred to us, but we neither of us dreamt of the truth. It
now appears that the cause of Palmerston's dismissal, for
dismissed he is, is his having committed the Government
to a full and unqualified approval of Louis Napoleon's <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup
d'État</i>, which he did in conversation with Walewski, but so
formally and officially, that Walewski wrote word to his own
Government that ours approved entirely of all that Louis
Napoleon had done. Upon this piece of indiscretion, to which
it is probable that Palmerston attached no importance, being
so used to act off his own bat, and never dreaming of any
danger from it, Lord John determined to act. I do not
know the details of the correspondence, only that he signified
to Palmerston his displeasure at his having thus committed
the Government to an approbation they did not feel,
and it ended in his turning Palmerston out, for this was in
fact what he did. But though this was the pretext, the
<i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="primary cause">causa causans</i> was without any doubt the Islington speech
and deputations, and his whole conduct in that affair. The
Queen had deeply resented it, and had had a discussion with
Lord John about it, for he rather defended Palmerston, and
accepted his excuses and denials. It is evident that he did
this, because he did not dare to quarrel with him on grounds
which would have enabled him to cast himself on the Radicals,
to appeal to all the Kossuthian sympathies of the country,
and to represent himself as the victim of our disgraceful subserviency
to Austria. But having thus passed over what
would have been a sufficient cause of quarrel, he at once
seized upon one much less sufficient, but which was not
liable to the same difficulties and objections. In fully
approving Louis Napoleon's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i>, Palmerston has
taken a part against the feelings of the Radicals, and if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
cause of the quarrel is made public, their approval will <i>ad hoc</i>
be rather with John Russell than with him.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>December 24th.</i>&mdash;To my unspeakable astonishment Granville
informed me yesterday that Clarendon had refused the
Foreign Office, and that he had accepted it. Lord John
must have given notice to Clarendon the day before the
Cabinet that he was going to propose him, or they could not
have heard yesterday. Clarendon declined, and advised
Lord John to offer it to Granville, which he instantly did,
and the thing was settled at once. I have not yet heard
from Clarendon, and am curious to know his motives for
refusing an appointment which I should have thought would
be not only peculiarly agreeable to him, but which would
have enabled him to quit Ireland in so honourable a manner.
In no other way could he have left his present post, just after
the recent trial of Birch <i>v.</i> Somerville, and this trial with its
disclosures must render it particularly irksome to him to
stay there. Granville, albeit conscious of the greatness of
the weight, accepted the office without a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>Brocket, Christmas Day.</i>&mdash;I received a letter from Clarendon
yesterday afternoon with his reasons for declining. They
are very poor ones, and amount to little more than his being
afraid of Palmerston, first of his suspecting it was an intrigue
to get rid of him, and secondly, of the difficulties Palmerston
would throw in his way at the Foreign Office. He had advised
Lord John to take Granville, but he said if it was
absolutely necessary, he would accept. I can't help thinking
he will be mortified at his advice being so immediately
taken. His conduct has been to my mind very pusillanimous
and unworthy of him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON'S VERSION.</div>

<p>Beauvale has had a long letter from Lady Palmerston
with her version of the whole affair, which is true in the
main, but as favourably coloured towards Pam as the case
will admit of. She is in a high state of indignation and
resentment, and bitter against Lord John and the colleagues
who did not support Palmerston. They evidently expected
when the Cabinet met the other day, that the colleagues
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
would have pronounced Lord John's ground of quarrel insufficient,
and protested against his dismissal, and they are
extremely mortified that nothing of the kind was done. She
complained that Palmerston's best friends were absent. Not
one person at the Cabinet said a word for him or made an
effort to keep him, but this she does not know. Her account
is as follows. On December 3rd Palmerston told Walewski <i>in
conversation</i> that he thought the President was fully justified
in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i>, as plots were hatching against him. He says
that he expressed his approbation in this conditional form.
Walewski wrote to Turgot what Palmerston had said, and at
the same time Palmerston wrote a very strong letter to Normanby,
finding fault with his conduct, and advising him to
hold language calculated to satisfy the President that he was
not unfriendly to him, as he had reason to believe that the
President did regard him as so inimical, that he was meditating
an application to the British Government to recall
him. Whatever Palmerston really did say to Walewski, we
may safely assume that Walewski made the most of it to
Turgot, and that he did convey to him the unqualified
approbation of the English Government, and Turgot probably
communicated Walewski's despatch to Normanby.
Normanby was exceedingly annoyed at this communication,
and wrote to John Russell, conveying to him what had
passed, and complaining of the ill-usage he had received.
Lord John shortly after wrote to Palmerston, sent him a
Minute of the Queen's, in which Her Majesty expressed her
displeasure at Palmerston's having committed her Government
by an unqualified approbation of the President's
measures, and he added from himself that he agreed with
her, and thought Palmerston had acted with great indiscretion,
that he was tired of these repeated difficulties
and disputes, and he had to inform him that it was the wish
of the Queen to transfer the Foreign Office to other hands.
Palmerston wrote a reply, stating his readiness to give up
the seals whenever his successor should be appointed. He
defended his own conduct, denied that he had committed
the Government, and said he had only expressed his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
individual opinion, and that a qualified one, and then set
forth the inconvenience there would be if a Minister could
not hold friendly communication with an Ambassador in his
own person, without being supposed to commit the whole
Cabinet, in mere conversation. It did not appear to me that
the excuses he made, according to Lady Palmerston's own
account of them, were very good ones, and they were not
likely to produce any effect upon Lord John, who had evidently
already determined to get rid of him. What more
passed I do not know, but from her letter they clearly entertained
some hopes that Palmerston's position was still retrievable;
that when the Cabinet met, his colleagues would
make an effort to retain him; and that in spite of what
Lord John had written to him he would have kept his post
if he could. It seems incredible that any man of high spirit
and with a spark of pride should consent to stay in office
after being told by the Prime Minister that he had been
indiscreet, that the Prime Minister was tired of his repeated
misconduct, and that the Queen wished to get rid of him.
But it seems by what Lady Palmerston says, that he would
have swallowed all this if he could have made it up. She
writes in a spirit of great bitterness and resentment, and
intimates her belief that the ground taken by Lord John
was merely a pretext, and not the real cause of what had
been done. In this she was quite right. The case is cumulative,
though the Paris communication is made the pretext
of Lord John's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i>. Beauvale thinks the last and
ostensible cause is insufficient, and that Lord John would
have done better to act at once on the matter of the Islington
deputations.  I am inclined to think it is sufficient,
though far less strong than the other, and it would have
been more straightforward as well as bold to have acted on
the first occasion, and I believe it would have been quite as
safe. Labouchere, a very honourable man, told me, when all
was known, he thought Lord John's conduct would come out
in a very favourable light. So probably there are circumstances
which Lady Palmerston suppresses, which would not
improve Palmerston's case. The most striking circumstance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
in all this affair is the conduct of John Russell. He took it
up, and without imparting what he was about to any of his
colleagues, leaving them all completely in the dark, he and
the Queen settled the whole thing between them. For nearly
three weeks a correspondence was going on between the
Queen, Lord John, and Palmerston, of which not one word
transpired, and which was known to nobody but the Duke of
Bedford. None of the Ministers had the least idea why they
were summoned. Lord Grey and Lord Lansdowne and Sir
Francis Baring all came up together from the Grange, asking
each other what it was about; nor was it till they were
all assembled in the Cabinet room in Downing Street that
they were apprised of the astounding fact that Palmerston
had ceased to be their colleague. The secret was as well
kept as Louis Napoleon's, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> nearly as
important and extraordinary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GRANVILLE FOREIGN SECRETARY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, December 27th.</i>&mdash;A Council at Windsor. Palmerston
did not come, but desired Lord Eddisbury to send the
seals to Lord John. Nevertheless he was expected, and the
Queen would wait for him above an hour. It now turns out
that the Foreign Office was not offered to Clarendon at all.
In his letter to me he says, It cannot be said that I refused
what was never offered me. Lord John wrote him word on
Sunday that it would be offered him; but the offer, which
Granville told me on Monday afternoon was gone, never did
go. All along the Queen and Lord John wished to have
Granville instead of Clarendon. He tells me that when I
know all that has passed between John Russell and himself, I
shall see he could not possibly accept it. Lord Lansdowne
was evidently put out by what he heard yesterday. He said
to me, 'You know it was offered to Clarendon.' I said, 'He
does not so consider it.' 'Oh! it certainly was. It was
clearly so understood in the Cabinet, when I left it on
Monday, and I wrote to him myself.' I said he had better
enquire, and he would find no offer was sent. He then talked
to John Russell and Grey, and I asked him afterwards, when
he shrugged his shoulders and said I was right; but he did
not understand it. The truth is oozing out by degrees. Grey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
and I had some talk about it, when I told him that I thought
the former ground, the reception of the deputations, the
stronger of the two, and I should have turned him out then,
and he said he agreed with me. Madame de Lieven writes
in transports of joy, and on the whole the satisfaction seems
very general. Granville is very popular at Manchester and
with the Free Traders, which is a great thing; and as he is
more of a Reformer than Palmerston, he will not be attacked
in that quarter. Brooks's and the ultra Whigs and Radicals
are sulky, but don't quite know what to make of it. It
seems Lord John struck the blow at last with great reluctance;
but having made up his mind, he did it boldly.</p>

<p>Bunsen told Reeve a version of the story, which he got
from Stockmar, and which came direct from the Court.
Normanby wrote home for instructions. At a Cabinet (on
the 8th) it was determined that he should be instructed
to abstain from expressing any opinion, but to act with
perfect civility and every expression of international amity
towards the President, but with reserve. Lord John went
down to Osborne on the 9th, and informed the Queen
of the resolution of the Cabinet. If, as Lady Palmerston
says, the conversation with Walewski had taken place before
this, Palmerston did not tell the Cabinet what he had said
to the Ambassador; but, be this as it may, they say he did
not act in the spirit of the Cabinet resolution, but in that of
his own communication, which was very different. I expect
that it will not be easy to make a good case out of this,
especially as the Queen's name must not be brought in.
Palmerston, who is so adroit and unscrupulous, will deny
half he said, and find plausible excuses for the other half,
and will probably make it appear that the ostensible <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="complaint">casus
querelæ</i> was not the real one. However, in matters of this
sort, Lord John is tolerably dexterous too, and he may have
better materials than I am aware of to employ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON AND HIS SUCCESSOR.</div>

<p>M. de Flahault arrived last night, and came here this
morning to talk to Granville. He said that Palmerston's dismissal
and the cause of it, as hinted at in the newspapers, had
produced a disagreeable impression at the Elysée, especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
after all the violence of the press. He said he had told the
President that what he had done could not fail to shock
English feelings and prejudices, and the press was sure to
hold such language. He received from Granville assurances
as pacific as he could desire, and he will probably have little
difficulty in satisfying the President and his Government
that they will lose nothing by the change. I have seen to-day
an admirable letter of Guizot's, full of a melancholy
resignation to a state of things he abhors, commiserating
and ashamed of the condition of his country. He says if he
was disposed to triumph over his enemies <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="of which he has many">il a bien de quoi</i>.
Where, he asks, is Thiers, where is the Republic, where is
Palmerston? France is now so frightened at Socialism,
and so bent on averting the peril of anarchy, that she will
submit to anything. But this panic will one day pass away,
and the Government cannot be carried on for ever by soldiers
and peasants, and in spite of all the intellect and all the
elevated classes in the country.</p>

<p>Yesterday Granville was with Palmerston for three hours.
He received him with the greatest cordiality and good
humour. 'Ah, how are you, Granville? Well, you have
got a very interesting office, but you will find it very
laborious; seven or eight hours' work every day will be
necessary for the current business, besides the extraordinary
and Parliamentary, and with less than that you
will fall into arrears.' He then entered into a complete
history of our diplomacy, gave him every sort of information,
and even advice; spoke of the Court without bitterness, and
in strong terms of the Queen's 'sagacity;' ended by desiring
Granville would apply to him when he pleased for any
information or assistance he could give him. This is very
creditable, and, whatever may come after it, very wise,
gentlemanlike, becoming, and dignified.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, January 2nd, 1852.</i>&mdash;Though I have given the
story of the late rupture in scraps, and have not made many
mistakes, I can now state the case in a more clear and connected
manner, and though this entails repetition I am
going to do it. It is best to go back to the first Kossuth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
affair. I need only say as to this, that when Lord John
brought it before the Cabinet he was supported against
Palmerston by every member of it except one, and that was
Lord Lansdowne. It is clear enough why he took Palmerston's
part. He had already committed himself by receiving
Pulsky at Bowood, two years ago. This made some noise
at the time, but it passed off. But he no doubt thought it
would be inconsistent to find fault with Palmerston for doing
what he had already done with regard to a refugee less celebrated,
but not less obnoxious than Kossuth. Then came
the Islington deputations and the speeches. Upon this,
though very indignant, more than I was aware of, Lord
John did not think it safe and therefore expedient to quarrel
with him, but he had a correspondence with him, in which
he expressed his opinion; and at the end of it he (in the
language of the Duke of Bedford) 'drew a moral, which
Palmerston accepted, as the rule for his future conduct.'
That is, he gave him to understand that if he continued his
separate and independent action without the knowledge,
and often against the opinions, of his colleagues, it was impossible
to go on. I do not know the words he employed,
but am confident this was the sense. Palmerston acquiesced
in his reply, and said what Lord John considered to be tantamount
to a promise or engagement that the like should
not happen again. It was about a week after, on December 3,
that Walewski went to Palmerston and asked for an expression
of his opinion upon the President's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i>.<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Palmerston
gave his unqualified approbation, which, of course,
Walewski instantly wrote off to Turgot. Very soon after,
if not before, Normanby wrote home for instructions as to
his conduct in the new state of things. The Cabinet met
on the 8th, and there it was agreed that he should be instructed
to adopt a friendly but reserved tone, and abstain
from any expression of opinion one way or another on the
acts of the President. On receipt of this he went to Turgot,
and when he spoke to him in the prescribed tone the French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
Minister said he was already acquainted with the sentiments
of the British Government, and he produced Walewski's
despatch informing him of Lord Palmerston's unqualified
approval of all that had been done. Of course Normanby
was thunderstruck at this communication, which revealed
a complete difference between Palmerston's assurance to
Walewski and his instructions to himself. Indignant at this,
and smarting under Palmerston's rebukes, he wrote to John
Russell and told him what had occurred. When the Queen
learned what had passed, she was disposed to insist upon
Lord John's taking this occasion to get rid of him; but
Stockmar very wisely advised her to do nothing, and told
her that the case was so flagrant, Lord John was almost
sure to propose it to her, which was much better than her
proposing it to him. She took this advice, and accordingly
Lord John did come to her, and said this could not be
endured, for it was besides a breach of faith, and he himself
proposed to the Queen that Palmerston should be dismissed
from the Foreign Office. About the same time, too (on the
12th), the Notes of the three Powers about the refugees had
been presented to Palmerston, and he had never said a word
about them. Then ensued the second correspondence, in
which there seems to have been great asperity on both sides.
Probably Palmerston never dreamt of any danger from his
conversation with Walewski, and his surprise was, therefore,
as great as his indignation. He defended himself, as I have
already stated, and he refused somewhat scornfully the
Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland. He said that John Russell
knew very well there were reasons why he could not accept
it, and he endeavoured to turn the offer itself against Lord
John, by saying that it was in itself a sufficient answer to
his charge of indiscretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON ON THE COUP D'ÉTAT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 8th.</i>&mdash;Graham came to me last night (as I am
laid up with the gout) at a quarter past nine, and went
away at twenty minutes after one. In the course of these
four hours we discussed every subject of interest that now
engages attention and, as may be imagined, pretty fully.
The Palmerston catastrophe, its circumstances, merits, bearings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
and probable results, Disraeli, the 'Life of George Bentinck,'
in the course of which he mentioned a great many
things about Peel, and, lastly, the political circumstances of
the Government, its condition and prospects, together with
his own and those of the party with which he is connected,
or rather some of the leading men of it. It would be impossible,
even were I so disposed, to give even an outline of
our long conversation. It will be sufficient to preserve
its general features, and his views on the present state of
things. I have never known him so confidential and unreserved,
nor has he ever before in his previous communications
with me spoken out so entirely. I gathered from him
some things I only imperfectly knew before of John Russell's
proceedings with a view to strengthen himself. What
he has done has been with the Duke of Newcastle, first
through the Duke of Bedford, and then by direct communication
with himself. Newcastle came to Graham as soon
as he arrived in town and told him all that had passed.
Lord John had invited him to take office, which Newcastle
declined, and he asked him to find out what Sidney Herbert's
disposition was. With regard to Gladstone (whom
Newcastle had alluded to), he had said that he was fully
aware of his great abilities, and should be glad if it was
in his power to offer him office, but he did not see how it
could be done, intimating, with expressions of respect, his
disinclination to any connexion in that quarter. With
Cardwell it was different. He asked the Duke to make a
communication to Cardwell, but he would only consent to
convey to Cardwell that he might expect at some indefinite
time an offer to be made to him. This communication, together
with what was intended, seems rather strange; it was
to this effect, that Lord Panmure would probably very soon
die being very old and very ill, and when he died and Fox
Maule must in consequence quit the War Office, Lord John
would offer Cardwell that place and a seat in the Cabinet.
Graham remarked that this was a strange proposal, considering
that the life of Panmure (who has been continually
dying and recovering for years past) is a better one than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
life of the Government, the latter being the more sick of
the two.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEELITES.</div>

<p>Then as to himself. The Duke said John Russell had
asked him to find out what his (Graham's) disposition was.
He could not say to 'sound him,' for he had made no use of
such a term, though he would do so for shortness. To this
Graham replied that the best answer he could make was to
tell him what had passed in September last, and to show him
the memorandum of Lord John to him, and his in return,
which he had never mentioned before but to Lord Aberdeen
and one other person, and that the sentiments he had then
expressed he still retained. As the Duke of Newcastle went
to Windsor yesterday, where he was to meet Lord John and
Lord Lansdowne, he will no doubt have told them what
passed, and to-day at the Cabinet Lord John will have to
announce that his attempts to strengthen himself have
failed.</p>

<p>Graham's opinions on the whole matter are pretty much
the same as those which Ellice has been circulating amongst
his friends. He thinks the present Government will not get
through the next Session; that weak and unpopular as they
are, and still further weakened by the loss of Palmerston,
and surrounded by dangers and enemies on all sides, they
must fall; and he does not think that his joining them,
or some of the other Peelites doing so, with or without
himself, would save them. It will not do to try and patch
up the old garment. This Government must be broken
up completely, there must be a <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="blank slate">tabula rasa</i>, and then an attempt
made to construct another on a wider and more comprehensive
plan. John Russell ought to go to the Queen
and tell her he cannot go on, and then she ought to send
for Aberdeen and Russell together, and desire them to set
about the formation of a Government. I suggested it
would never do to send for Aberdeen in this way; it would
be taken as an insult to Palmerston, and exasperate one
half of the Whigs and render them unmanageable. The
Queen might indeed send for Aberdeen alone, and he might
decline everything for himself, refuse to take office, as no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
doubt he would, but advise her to send for Lord John
and Graham, and bid them to form a Government. He
agreed to my amendment; acknowledged the antagonism
of Palmerston and Aberdeen would make a difficulty; but
contended that they should be empowered to make a
Government of men of Liberal-Conservative principles, of
which John Russell must himself be the head; that it
should be understood that they had <i>carte blanche</i>. Nobody
was to have pretensions or <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="almost">quasi</i> right to office on account
of previous tenure, but that they were to make the best
and strongest Administration they could, taking in any
efficient men who might be ready to unite with them on the
principles above mentioned. He thought the best thing for
the country would be that this <i>break up</i> should happen now,
before Parliament met, and the attempt at reconstruction
made, while people were still free and uncommitted; but he
owned that it would be very difficult for John Russell, after
what had recently passed, to take such a course. He would
not do so himself in his place, and could not expect him to
do so. He might indeed have consistently given the thing
up when he quarrelled with Palmerston, because he had always
said, and repeated it a hundred times, that without
Palmerston he could not go on. But after the Cabinet had
agreed to go on, and to support him in what he had done,
it was very difficult for him without any fresh incident to
turn round on them, say he had changed his mind, and
break up the Government. I suggested this last view, which
he concurred in. The end of it was, he said, that Lord
John would be obliged to meet Parliament, fight his battle
as best he could, and he would die in the open field with
harness on his back. This result, sooner or later, he considers
certain. As to himself, besides his general objections
to join the Government, he is deeply impressed with
the difficulty of the new Reform Bill. He could not, he
says, be a party to advising the Queen to announce in her
Speech that the present system is all wrong, and must be
amended, which he assumes must and will be done. He
recurs again and again to the folly of having moved this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
matter, 'set a stone rolling' which they have no power to
stop. I differed from him considerably in what seemed to
me the exaggerated view he takes of this question, and said
I did not see why any such announcement need be made in
the Queen's Speech. But he is evidently afraid to encounter
and be mixed up with this matter, on which he feels deep
displeasure, dislike, and much apprehension. He spoke
amicably of John Russell, but was not pleased with his
sending George Lewis down to him, and could not believe
he ever seriously expected him to accept an invitation at
that time, and, he contemptuously added, to such an office;
and he rather complained of the formality and stiffness of
Lord John's Memorandum on that occasion. But he appears
to have been still more nettled at having been 'sounded' by
Newcastle on the part of Lord John. 'Why,' he says, 'did
not Lord John ask him to come to Chesham Place, and talk
the whole matter over with him frankly?' They have had
so many and such confidential and friendly communications
at different times, that this would have been a most natural
and becoming course, or Lord John might have spoken to
me about it; but to get the Duke of Newcastle, with whom
he was on no terms of intimacy or confidence, to 'sound
him,' was not the way he might expect to be dealt with.
I think this is a pretty faithful summary of the essential
part of what passed between us on this the most important
head. If other things occur to me of any interest, I will
subjoin them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROJECTS FOR A COALITION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 11th.</i>&mdash;Graham came to me again last night.
He was more gloomy in his expectations, and saw nothing
but dangers ahead. He had seen George Lewis and told
him all he had said to me. George Lewis had seen John
Russell, and of course repeated it all to him, and the result
was at all events amicable, for he told me that Lord John
had sent him a message by George Lewis to say if he
would come to town a day or two before Parliament met he
would tell him what he was going to do. He now thinks
that if this Government is defeated and resigns, Lord John
will refuse to have anything to do with the formation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
another, and this might again bring about a fresh Protectionist
attempt. He wavers between his apprehension of Palmerston
joining the Protectionists, and his doubts of the
possibility of such an alliance in the teeth too of the Queen's
antipathy to Palmerston; but he is not at all sure the next
election may not make the Protectionists numerically strong
enough to undertake the task they failed in accomplishing
last year. It is not worth while to record a conversation
which was to a certain degree a repetition of the last, and
without any novel matter. He shakes his head at the prospect
of explanations, and thinks John Russell will have a
good deal of difficulty in making out his case.</p>

<p>Then he is moved by the letters written by Lansdowne,
Grey, and Charles Wood to Palmerston expressive of regret
at parting with him. It is pretty evident, that however
plausible may be the scheme of a comprehensive administration,
the personal predilections and antipathies will create
enormous difficulties. The Whigs generally hate the Peelites,
and Graham especially. The Peelites hate the Whigs.
Mutual dislike exists between Graham on one side, and Newcastle,
Gladstone, and Sidney Herbert on the other. The
three latter are High Churchmen of a deep colour, which
makes it difficult to mix them up with any other party, so that
the Peelite leaders are extremely divided, and the party is
so scattered that it can hardly be called a party. The
Whigs, who really are a party, and, though in a state of
great insubordination, do generally consider themselves one
army and under one chief, do not at all like the idea of treating
with the Peelites on anything like equal terms. If ever
the time comes I fully expect they will all resist any such
basis of arrangement, and that John Russell will not be disposed
to agree to a Government being formed by himself <i>and</i>
anybody else. These difficulties and causes of future bickering
looming in the distance present themselves to me. I
only hope they may prove visionary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA AND LOUIS NAPOLEON.</div>

<p>There is certainly a great deal of sulky disapprobation
at Palmerston's dismissal, and all sorts of stories, and as
many lies are rife about it. The Palmerstons affect moderation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
but their rage and resentment overflow in every direction.
He puts a good face on it, and appears calm and
cheerful; she holds different language to different people,
but loses no opportunity of getting up all the steam she can
against Lord John. Meanwhile Granville is doing well in
his office, and the staff there, who have been so long accustomed
to Palmerston, and are critical judges, think so.
Cowley told me he had seen some of his papers, and they
were very good, and he particularly mentioned one to Russia.
The Emperor Nicholas has sent over to say that it is very
possible Louis Napoleon may any day be proclaimed Emperor,
and that all the Powers were bound by the Treaty
of Vienna not to acknowledge any one of the family as such,
and he begged, should this event arrive, that we would do
nothing about it without previous communication with him,
so that England and Russia might act in concert. Granville
replied with great civility, and expressed a concurrence in
the desire that England and Russia should act in concert,
but declined to engage that this Government would wait
till communication could be had with Russia, representing
that the news of any change in France would reach London
in an hour, and the official notification of it in a day, and
that it might be necessary for us to come to some early decision,
whereas a communication with Russia would take several
weeks; and he also pointed out that we had a much greater
and more immediate interest than Russia in what was passing
in France, and must act for ourselves in certain cases
which might occur.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 13th.</i>&mdash;Lord Normanby came to me yesterday to
talk over his affairs.<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
No love is lost between him and Palmerston.
I asked him to tell me frankly what he had ever
said or done to provoke the enmity of Louis Napoleon, and
he declared that he was not conscious of having done anything
whatever; that he had continued to live as heretofore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
with his old friends, and that was all. The President had
always been as civil and cordial in his manner as ever, and
if he had any enmity towards him he must be a great
hypocrite, as he never testified any. When he last saw him
he begged Louis Napoleon, if he heard anything of him that
he thought he had a right to complain of, that he would tell
it himself frankly. Louis Napoleon replied that <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="frankness">la franchise</i>
was always best, and he would. Napoleon complained much
of Palmerston, not only for this last affair but on various
occasions, when he had given just offence to France by his
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="processes">procédés</i>. Normanby laughs at the notion of a plot, and
says the best proof that it was an after-thought is that when
Turgot immediately after the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> gave him the reasons
for what the President had done, he never alluded to any plot;
and whereas it has been supposed that the refusal of the
Chamber to vote the revision of the Constitution was one of
the causes, Turgot told him that one cause was their having
ascertained that the revision would be carried, as the Reds
were going to vote for it. They intended to take this course,
because they believed that with universal suffrage another
Assembly would be returned of their colour, and for the
same reason therefore Louis Napoleon hurried on his <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
d'état</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. THIERS ON THE COUP D'ÉTAT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>January 14th.</i>&mdash;Granville brought me yesterday a paper
which by the Queen's desire, communicated through Lord
John, he has been obliged to draw up. It is a developement
of what the foreign policy of this country ought to be. He
read it to me that I might criticise it. He has not yet had
practice enough in composition to write well; but it is
clear, sensible, and right. But after all it was a series of
commonplaces, for the simple reason that there is nothing
mysterious and abstruse in the foreign policy of this country,
and in the substance of it there can be little or no
difference between different governments or men. There
was not a word in Granville's paper to which both Palmerston
and Aberdeen might not subscribe. In diplomacy,
above everything, <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="it is the tone that made ​​the song">c'est le ton qui fait la chanson</i>, and it
has been Palmerston's tone and manner which have done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
much more harm than his acts; they have undoubtedly been
very often unjustifiable and offensive to a great degree; but
they have been rendered ten times more so, and, therefore,
ten times more mischievous than they would have been by
his <i>animus</i> and his language. Besides laying down the
rights and the duties of this country, which he very properly
states may be resolved into the moral axiom of doing as we
would be done by, Granville enters upon a new subject, and
that is the improvement of the <i>personnel</i> of our diplomacy&mdash;the
advancement of men of ability, and who display
qualities which will fit them for high posts abroad. He
tells me, too, that he meditates a system of examination,
which will no doubt please the educational propensities of
the Prince.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 15th.</i>&mdash;I dined with Ellice yesterday&mdash;a <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="party of four">partie
carrée</i>&mdash;himself, Thiers, Mrs. Grote, and myself.<a id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> It was
very amusing. The little man was <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="tireless">intarissable</i>, and gave us
an account of all that had happened to him from the moment
of his arrest to that of his expulsion from Brussels&mdash;for such
it really was, though he went voluntarily, and the Belgian
Ministers told him they would not expel him if he chose to
stay, and would refuse compliance with the demands of the
French Government. He has some idea of writing a narrative
of the last two months, and we encouraged him to do
so. He positively denies not only that there was any plot
whatever, but that there was any intention of taking active
measures against the President; they only contemplated
defensive measures, and their object was to surround themselves
with a military force to protect the Assembly against the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> which the President was meditating, and which
he was enabled to execute because they were unprotected.
The French troops will always obey their commanders, and
this accounts for the complete success of Louis Napoleon;
but '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="the red pants">les pantalons rouges</span>' will not fire upon '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="other red pants;">d'autres
pantalons rouges;</span>' and if the Assembly had had its guard,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
the troops under the order of the Minister at War would
not have attacked their comrades. Thiers knew of this
intended <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> for a long time before (in the beginning
of October), and told us how it came to his knowledge. M.
de Lariboissière, son of Napoleon's general, and a rich man,
was sent for by the President about the end of September.
He told him his project, asked him to join and take office.
Lariboissière declined, and went back to his house in the
country. Being a great friend of Thiers, he thought he
could not leave him to get into the scrape that was preparing
for him, and he accordingly employed a lady who was
staying with him to go to Paris and give Thiers <i>a hint</i>,
merely that he had better quit Paris, or he would get into
trouble. Thiers knew perfectly well what this meant, and
did all he could to make his friends aware of the danger
that was impending over them, and to take precautions
instead of being caught '<span class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="like idiots,">comme des nigauds,</span>' as they
eventually were. He spoke with prodigious contempt both
of the character and the talents of Louis Napoleon.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>January 28th.</i>&mdash;I have had two long conversations with
the Duke of Bedford, who has been very open and communicative,
though I don't know that he told me much that
I did not know before. He gave me some minute details,
which were perhaps rather different from previous statements
I had heard and noted, but not materially so. These
corrigenda related principally to the communications between
Lord John and Palmerston, and are hardly worth noticing
except for the sake of circumstantial accuracy. He said
that in the Kossuth question his first communication with
Palmerston was personal, and at Windsor; and on Palmerston's
persisting in his intention to see Kossuth, Lord John
wrote him a letter, and then on getting his impertinent answer
he summoned the Cabinet. After the Islington deputations
he wrote again to Palmerston in excessively mild terms, but
took that opportunity of remonstrating with him against
his habit of separate and independent action, and it was
then he received what he considered tantamount to an
engagement that he would cease to pursue that course. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
was a week after that, while he was at Woburn, that he
received from Normanby the information which he conceived
to be a violation on Palmerston's part of the engagement;
and then he said to the Duke that he could stand it
no longer, and would get rid of him. He accordingly wrote
at once to Palmerston, recapitulated his subjects of complaint,
and asked him to authorise him to lay his resignation
before the Queen. His first step, therefore, was with
Palmerston himself, and not with the Queen. Having
received the authority (which Palmerston could not refuse),
he proceeded to communicate with the Queen, and the reply
expressed the great astonishment of both Her Majesty and
the Prince, as they had taken it for granted that this
difference, like all preceding ones, would be patched up. I
told the Duke that I had reason to believe the Queen was
displeased at the offer of Ireland being made to Palmerston
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="without her knowing">à son insu</i>; but this was a mistake. Lord John did communicate
to her immediately the letter he wrote to Palmerston,
containing not <i>an offer</i>, but an intimation that he
would propose it to Her Majesty if he was disposed to accept
it. This was certainly the proper and constitutional course
for him to take. He does, indeed, understand his duty in
this respect, and is very different from Palmerston; he never
conceals anything from the Queen, and invariably enters into
her objections, admitting or refuting them, when she makes
any. Palmerston's way was to make no answer whatever
when she made objections; to take no notice of them; a
practice which Lord John had himself blamed, and remonstrated
with him upon. This, and the still more monstrous
habit he had of treating with contempt alterations that had
been prescribed to him, and sending despatches from which
the Queen or Lord John had struck out certain passages
with the same restored, had excited her resentment to a
high pitch.</p>

<p>I find Normanby has been in fact <i>recalled</i>, though it is
agreed that he is to <i>resign</i> so as to be let down easily. He
puts a good face on it, but is very indignant, and thinks
himself very ill-used. His vanity is very amusing, for he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
talks of his great influence, and the respect and consideration
in which he was universally held, when everybody knows
that there never was an Ambassador so generally disliked
and despised. It was intended to send Clanricarde there,
but it was altered, I do not know why, and Cowley appointed,
to his great delight and astonishment, and to mine. Cowley,
who was at Windsor the other day, told me he saw a most
curious and interesting paper there which Stockmar showed
him. It was a report from Van de Weyer to King Leopold
of his interviews with the President while he was at Paris.
He complained very much of the English newspapers, as
well as of our Queen's hostile feeling towards him. Van de
Weyer told him he must not be surprised if in a Constitutional
country like England the press spoke the language it did;
and as to the Queen's friendship for the Orleans family, his
own chivalrous feeling could only approve of her continuing
to them in their adversity the friendship which had been
formed in their prosperous days. It seems Louis Napoleon
had promised to leave Leopold alone, and not meddle with
Belgium, but held threatening language towards Switzerland
and Piedmont.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPLANATIONS IN PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>February 5th.</i><a id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>&mdash;I might have saved myself the trouble
of writing down a scattered and imperfect notice of the
Palmerstonian dismissal, since John Russell told the whole
story on Tuesday night. The public interest and curiosity
to hear the 'explanations' were intense. Up to almost
the last moment the confidence and the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="conceit">jactance</i> of the
Palmerston clique were boundless. At length the moment
arrived. In all my experience I never recollect such a triumph
as John Russell achieved, and such complete discomfiture
as Palmerston's. Lord John made a very able speech, and
disclosed as much as was necessary, and no more. Beyond
all doubt his great <i>coup</i> was the Queen's Minute in 1850,
which was absolutely crushing. Some grave persons think
the introduction of her name was going too far, but it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
irresistible. The effect was prodigious. Palmerston was
weak and inefficient, and it is pretty certain that he was
taken by surprise, and was unprepared for all that John
Russell brought forward. Not a man of weight or influence
said a word for him, nobody but Milnes and Dudley Stuart.
The Queen's letter was decisive, for it was evident that his
conduct must have been intolerable to elicit such charges
and rebukes; and it cannot fail to strike everybody that no
man of common spirit, and who felt a consciousness of
innocence, would have brooked anything so insulting. Such
a man would have indignantly resigned, and have demanded
what John Russell meant by making himself the organ of
such accusations; but he submitted to them.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, March 26th.</i>&mdash;I was taken ill before I had time to
finish what I was writing, and have been laid up ever since
with a violent attack of gout and fever, from which I am now
slowly recovering. During all the time of the change of Government<a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>
I was in my bed, and not allowed to see anybody;
but for the last few days I have been able to come into my
drawing-room and receive visitors, who have come in great
numbers, and of every imaginable variety, to see me, so that
I have had enough of occupation and amusement. I cannot
pretend to write any account of what has been passing, and
not having recorded, as I heard them, the scraps of unknown
matters, I am now unable to do so. The new Government
is treated with great contempt, and many of the appointments
are pitiable. But, while it is the fashion to exalt
Derby himself, and treat with great scorn almost all his
colleagues, I think Derby himself is quite as unfit for the
post of Prime Minister as any of them can be for those they
occupy. His extreme levity and incapacity for taking grave
and serious views, though these defects may be partially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
remedied by the immensity of his responsibility, will ever
weigh upon his character, and are too deeply rooted in it to
be eradicated. His oratory is his forte, and without that he
would be a very ordinary man. His speeches since he took
office have been excellent, and in a very becoming tone and
spirit; but the notion, which is generally entertained, of his
being so high-minded and chivalrous, is a mistake. He is
not so in private life&mdash;that is, in his transactions on the turf&mdash;and
it is not likely that a man should be one thing in
private, and another in public, life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD DERBY'S ADMINISTRATION.</div>

<p>The great object of interest and curiosity this Session
has been Palmerston; everybody anxious to see to which
side he leaned. A short time ago he evinced a disposition
towards reconciliation with John Russell. The latter invited
him to his meeting at Chesham Place; Palmerston did not
go, but was rather pleased at being invited; and soon after
John Russell went to one of Lady Palmerston's parties, and
talked to Palmerston a good while. But at this time his
resentment was still unappeased, for he got Clarendon to
hear all his complaints, and showed him all the correspondence.
With his usual unfairness, he complained to everybody
of John Russell's having so unexpectedly sprung upon
him the Queen's Minute in the discussion on his dismissal,
and he even did so to Clarendon; whereas, so far from any
surprise, Lord John wrote him word three days before that
he was going to read it in the House, and offered him any
papers he might desire to have. Clarendon asked him if
he had not received such a communication, and then he
was forced to own he had. Clarendon, however, did his
best to bring about a renewal of their intercourse, personal
and political. Palmerston said John Russell had given
him his independence, and he meant to avail himself of
that advantage. The Whigs expect and desire that he
will return to them, and, in the event of a change, come
again into office, but not the Foreign Office, which he says
himself he does not again wish for. Derby offered him
office, which he at once refused, on hearing that Protection
was not given up; but many think he will after all join
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
Derby, as soon as this question is finally disposed of. I
doubt it, for he would not serve under Disraeli, and Disraeli
would hardly give up the leadership having once enjoyed
it. The Peelites sit together, all except Graham, who has
regularly joined John Russell, and sits beside him. Nobody
knows what they mean to do, nor which party they will
eventually join. At present Gladstone's speeches do not
look like a junction with Derby, but nothing is more possible
than that, as soon as the great stumbling-block is removed,
they will go over to this Government, and the leaders take
office. They most of them hate the Whigs, and there is
certainly no great, if any, difference of opinion between them
and the Derbyites, except on the question of Free Trade.
Graham rather expects this result. I asked him if he
thought Disraeli would consent to resign the lead to anybody.
He thought not, certainly not to Gladstone; possibly
he might to Palmerston. There are great complaints of
Disraeli in the House of Commons. They say he does not
play his part as leader with tact and propriety, and treats
his opponents impudently and uncourteously, which is egregiously
foolish, and will end by exposing him to some great
mortification; the House of Commons will not stand such
behaviour from such a man.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, May 2nd.</i>&mdash;I have been for some time past so
disgusted with politics and politicians, and have been driven
to take such a gloomy view of affairs and of our prospects,
that I could not bring myself to resume my task of noting
down such matters as might appear not wholly unworthy of
being recorded. At last I have resolved to run over the
principal occurrences of the last few weeks. The Derby
Government has been sinking more and more in public
opinion. The shuffling and reserve of Derby in the House
of Lords, coupled with the declarations on the hustings of
his adherents, especially Kelly, Solicitor-General, and the
extraordinary and still unexplained escapade of Walpole in
the House of Commons about giving votes to the Militia,<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
have all tended to bring them into discredit and contempt.
The Opposition were much elated at seeing the Government
in this state, and in fact they had a very good game to play,
when the petulance, obstinacy, and imprudence of John
Russell brought upon them a disastrous defeat, and set
up the Government completely. Without concert with his
followers, and against the advice and remonstrances of those
who were apprised of his intention, he came down to the
House, and opposed the second reading of the Militia Bill.
The fault was enormous, for the inconsistency was glaring.
Palmerston instantly fell upon him with the greatest acrimony,
and lashed him with excessive severity, carrying the
House along with him, and evidently enjoying the opportunity
of thus paying off old scores. Seymour spoke against
Lord John, and many of his own friends and supporters
voted against him, so that there was a majority of two
to one in a full House.<a id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Nothing could exceed the exultation
of the Ministerialists, but the resentment and indignation
of the Opposition, who saw all their hopes and prospects
marred by this extraordinary blunder on the part of their
chief. John Russell was denounced as unfit to lead a party;
still more, again, to be at the head of a Government. His
best friends could not defend him, and, while he has done
irreparable damage to his own political character and influence,
he has thrown the Opposition into such disorganisation
and confusion, that it will be difficult for them to act any
more with union or effect. The Peelites are of course disgusted,
and, never liking John Russell, will be less than
ever inclined to form a junction with him. Palmerston's
conduct in this debate paves the way for his joining Derby
if he chooses it, and it is by no means improbable that
a large proportion of the Peelites will do the same.
The probability of this is increased by Disraeli's speech
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
the night before last, on bringing on his Budget. This was
a great performance, very able, and was received with great
applause in the House. But the extraordinary part of it was
the frank, full, and glowing panegyric he passed on the effect
of the Free Trade measures of Sir Robert Peel, proving by
elaborate statistics the marvellous benefits which had been
derived from his tariffs and reduction of duties&mdash;not, however,
alluding to Corn. All this was of course received with delight
and vehemently cheered by the Whigs and Peelites, but
in silence and discontent by his own side. It was neither
more nor less than a magnificent funeral oration upon Peel's
policy, and as such it was hailed, without any taunting, or
triumphing, or reproaches, on account of his former conduct
to Peel, except a few words from Hume and Wakley. It
is difficult to say what may be the effect of this speech,
but it seems impossible that Protection in any shape can
be attempted after it; and it certainly opens a door to the
admission of any Peelites who may be disposed to join a
Conservative Government, for even their personal feelings
against Dizzy will be mitigated by it. Graham has not been
in the House all this time, being laid up with the gout at
Netherby.<a id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p class="entry"><i>London, May 12th, 1852.</i>&mdash;On Monday night came on
the trial of strength, which the Opposition had determined
to have with the Government, and which the latter very unaccountably
provoked.<a id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> The leaders made great exertions to
bring the several sections of parties together, and completely
succeeded. The only doubt was about the 'Brigadiers,' as
the Irish squadron are called, who it was feared might refuse
to go into the same lobby with John Russell on any terms,
but it ended in their adhesion. The Duke of Newcastle told
me they hoped for a majority of fifty, therefore eighty-six was
far beyond their most sanguine expectations. No immediate
consequences will follow, but it was a severe check to the
Government, and the more important from the circumstance
of Gladstone's being the leader of the Opposition, and Palmerston
voting with the majority. Derby affected indifference,
and said to John Russell at the Queen's ball the same night,
'What will you get by all this?' It will probably accelerate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
the dissolution, for which they must now themselves be
anxious, to put an end to the present state of affairs, and
relieve them even for a time from the position into which
their embarrassment and all their shuffling and double
dealing have placed them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INCONSISTENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>The conduct of the Government is regarded with indignation
and contempt by all thinking people, out of the pale
of their own thick and thin supporters; but it does not seem
to make much impression upon the country at large, nobody
appears to care one straw about anybody or anything. There
is very general prosperity and contentment, and people are
indifferent about politics, and who is in or out of office.
There is no public man who enjoys any popularity, or has
a hold upon the regard or the good opinions of the masses.
If Derby remains in power it will be from the enormous
difficulty of forming any other government, for, strangely
enough, while a short time ago everybody said a Derby
Government was impossible, it now appears to be the only
government which is possible. All, however, is confusion
and uncertainty, and so will remain till the next Parliament
meets, and the state and relative strength of parties is
manifested.</p>

<p>The object of the Ministerialists is to catch votes by
representing themselves as Conservatives, and creating as
much doubt and uncertainty as they can about their intentions
on the most exciting topics, such as Free Trade
and Popery. It is supposed that there is under a smooth
exterior considerable discord in the Protectionist ranks,
and even in the Cabinet. Disraeli's Free Trade speech on
the Budget evidently gave deep offence to his party, for he
felt himself obliged to make a sort of recantation a night or
two afterwards; and Derby took the very unusual course of
making a political speech at the Mansion House dinner, and
in it, with much show of compliment to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, did his best to neutralise the Budget speech of
the latter by a long and laboured exposition of the doctrine
of compromise, which he said entered practically into all
the policy and even institutions of the country&mdash;all which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
seemed to imply that he meant to strike a balance, in some
protective shape, between the manufacturing and agricultural
interests. This speech, which was not particularly
good, has been universally considered as a snub to Disraeli.</p>

<p>Last night Spooner brought on his motion for an enquiry
into Maynooth, when Walpole made a strong anti-Maynooth
speech, going much farther in that direction than Derby
had ever hinted at in the House of Lords; but such is their
language at different times and in different places, that it
is utterly impossible to guess what they think, mean, or
intend; a studied ambiguity conceals their principles and
their policy, if they have either. It would, however, look
as if they meant to pander to the 'No-Popery' rage which
is now so rife, and to make the country believe they intend
to give effect to the passionate desire, which no doubt largely
prevails, to attack the Catholics in some way.<a id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> This desire
is very strong and general in this country, but in Scotland
it is universal. Aberdeen told me the whole country was
on fire, and they would like nothing so much as to go to
Ireland and fight, and renew the Cromwellian times, giving
the Papists the option of going to 'Hell or Connaught.' As
Ireland is equally furious, and the priests will send sixty or
seventy members full of bigotry and zeal, all ready to act
together under the orders of Cullen and Wiseman, we may
look for more polemical discussion, and that of the most
furious character, than we have ever seen before, even during
the great Emancipation debates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GENERAL ELECTION.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>Bath, July 7th.</i>&mdash;The elections are now begun,<a id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and a
few days will disclose whether Derby's Government will be
able to stand its ground or not. Both parties are excessively
confident, for at this moment the world may be divided
between the supporters and opponents of the present Government,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
though the latter will be split into a dozen different
factions when Parliament meets. The first act of
the Derby drama has been curious enough; they have in
some respects done better and in some worse than was expected
of them. Derby himself has shuffled and prevaricated
and involved himself in a studied and laboured ambiguity,
which has exposed him to bitter taunts and reproaches, and
Disraeli has been a perfect will-o'-the-wisp, flitting about
from one opinion to another, till his real opinions and intentions
are become matter of mere guess and speculation.
He has given undoubted proofs of his great ability, and
showed how neatly he could handle such a subject as finance,
with which he never can have been at all familiar; but
having been well taught by his subalterns, and applying a
mind naturally clear, ready, and acute to the subject, he
contrived to make himself fully master of it, and to produce
to the House of Commons a financial statement the
excellence of which was universally admitted and gained
him great applause. Whatever his motives were&mdash;whether
because it was all true, and he could not resist the force of
truth, or that he thought <i>that</i> the best opportunity he could
find for evacuating an untenable position, he pronounced
such a full and unreserved panegyric on the results of Free
Trade, and so clearly stated them in detail, that his speech
was hailed as a practical conversion, and as such cheered
vehemently by the Whigs, and received in gloomy silence
by his own people. On subsequent occasions he attempted
to shuffle out of his previous declarations, and as they cannot
afford to quarrel with him, and a great many are like
him and obliged to back out of Protection also, no schism
has taken place. On all subjects of interest the Government
have taken a doubtful, undecided course, and abstained from
any bold enunciation of principles and course of action,
always temporising, and trying to keep up the hopes of
every party and interest by their ambiguous language. On
Maynooth, on the Education Question, and the Privy Council
Minute, they did this, evidently for electioneering purposes:
afraid in one case of affronting Protestant bigotry, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
the other wanting to stimulate the zeal of the Churchmen
in their favour.</p>

<p>The appointment that created the greatest surprise, and
was the most criticised, that of Sir John Pakington, has
turned out, as far as it has gone, one of the best. He has
done his business in the House of Commons very fairly,
has committed no glaring faults, and has a very tolerable
character in his office for industry and apprehension. Walpole,
who was thought one of the most capable, has been a
failure. He had the folly to make a strong anti-Catholic
speech on the Maynooth grant, and he got into the ridiculous
scrape about the votes to Militiamen, which he was forced
so awkwardly to withdraw amidst a storm of ridicule from
every quarter, the real history of which has never yet been
explained. The other members of the Cabinet have appeared
as mere dummies, and in the House of Lords Derby has
never allowed any of them to speak, taking on himself to
answer for every department. Young Stanley does not seem
to have had much success in the House of Commons, nor to
afford much promise of attaining excellence hereafter, at
least as an orator. The Chancellor has done very well in his
Court, administering justice ably and expeditiously, and
<i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="willingly or unwillingly">nolens aut volens</i> he has concurred in carrying through Parliament
some very important law reforms, which will be
followed by more. It is by no means unlikely that more
has been done in this way than if John Russell's Government
had not been thrown out. Lyndhurst came out with
great force, and his speech on the Baron de Bode's case
was a masterpiece, which was worthy of his more vigorous
age, and drew general admiration. Brougham has been
extremely quiet and reasonable, devoting himself almost
entirely to law reforms, and doing great service, acting
a very honourable and useful part. The Opposition have,
on the whole, been very moderate and forbearing, with the
sole exception of John Russell's opposition to the Militia
Bill, which was a great blunder, and drew on him much
resentment and disgust on the part of his own friends and
adherents. They appear now to have in great measure forgotten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
and forgiven this unhappy blunder. Palmerston's
course has been thoroughly eccentric, and to this hour
nobody can make out what he is at, nor what are the
motives and the objects of his conduct. At one time it
looked as if he was aiming at a junction with Derby, but he
voted with Gladstone in his great attack on the Government,
and his language has been uniformly that of their opponent,
and as if he still considered himself one of the Whig party,
though a perfectly independent one. He has taken a pretty
active part during the Session, and a very characteristic
one, seldom losing an opportunity of saying something
spiteful about his former colleagues, and dealing largely
in those liberal clap-traps which have always been the
chief part of his political stock-in-trade. He wound up
the Session by a bitter attack on Granville and John Russell,
when the latter was not in the House, and the House of
Lords had ended its sittings, so the former had no opportunity
of answering him. He was quite wrong in what he
said, and so far as Granville and Lord John were concerned
could have been easily answered, but he broke out in his
old style about foreign politics and Austria, all of which
was loudly cheered and greatly admired by his Radical
friends, but the whole exhibition regretted and blamed by
the more sensible of his own adherents. This speech proved
that he has given up all idea of returning to the Foreign
Office, which indeed he professes not to desire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON ATTACKS THE WHIGS.</div>

<p>The above is a very brief and imperfect sketch of the
spirit in which the recent short Session has been carried
on by the different parties and leaders, presenting a very
unsatisfactory prospect for the future; for while a more
disgraceful and more degraded Government than this cannot
be imagined, it is difficult to see, if they fall, how any
fresh combination can be formed, likely to be efficient,
popular, and durable. It will be equally difficult to do
without, and to do with, John Russell. The Whigs will
acknowledge no other leader; their allegiance to him is
very loose and capricious; he has lost his popularity and
his prestige in the country, and has very little personal influence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
Then the unappeasable wrath of the Irish Catholics,
who will come to Parliament brigaded together, and above
all things determined on his personal exclusion, will make
any Government of which he is either the head, or the
House of Commons leader, next to impossible. Nothing
in the present balanced state of parties can resist a compact
body of sixty or seventy men acting together by word
of command, and putting a veto on one particular man.
No past services nor any future expectations will atone for
the Durham Letter, which they seem pledged to a man never
to forget or forgive. The country all this time seems to be
in a state of complete indifference. The elections are carried
on by the opposite parties, but there appears to be no
strong current of public opinion in favour of or against
any men or any measures. While the press thunders away
against Derby and the deep dishonour of his political conduct,
the masses seem mighty indifferent on the subject,
and as the very conduct that is impugned is principally his
shuffling out of his engagement to the cause of Protection,
people only become more indifferent from seeing that Free
Trade is virtually safe, and so long as the great prosperity
now prevailing continues, the country at large does not
seem to care a straw whether Lord Derby or Lord anybody
else is in office. The zeal of the party in power is always
greater <i class="grn" lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="other things being equal">ceteris paribus</i> than of that in Opposition, unless
some great object is in agitation and at stake, and the
Derbyites will make more strenuous efforts to keep the
power they have got, than their opponents will make to
wrest it from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, July 23rd.</i>&mdash;After passing a fortnight at Bath,
I returned to town, a fortnight ago. The elections are now
nearly over, all indeed except some in Ireland. They have
been on the whole very unsatisfactory in every respect, and
nothing can be more unpromising than our political prospects.
The end has been a very considerable gain to the
Government, one with which they profess to be perfectly
satisfied, and they are quite confident of being able to defeat
any attempts to turn them out. In this, I think, they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
right, for they certainly will have more than 300 in the
House of Commons, all Derbyites, staunch supporters, and
moveable like a regiment. The Opposition will number as
many, or perhaps rather more; but that is counting Whigs,
Radicals of different degrees, Peelites, and the Irish Brigade,&mdash;different
factions, greatly at variance amongst each other,
and who will rarely combine for any political object. There
may be about fifty or sixty people who will not consider
themselves as belonging to the Government nor to the
Opposition, but of whom the majority will probably support
the Government, except on particular questions. Disraeli
boasts that he shall have 330 followers, and that he knows
where to look for stray votes. He probably overrates his
regular force, but he will no doubt get a great many of the
neutrals. The most remarkable and most deplorable features
of the recent election are the exclusion of so many
able and respectable men; the malignant and vindictive as
well as stupid and obstinate spirit evinced by the constituencies,
especially the agricultural, and their bigotry
and prejudices, as well as their total indifference to character
and intellectual eminence. The conduct of the
Government and their supporters has been just what might
have been expected from their language in Parliament: they
have sacrificed every other object to that of catching votes;
at one time and at one place representing themselves as
Free Traders, and in another as Protectionists, and everywhere
pandering to the ignorance and bigotry of the masses
by fanning the No-Popery flame. Disraeli announced that
he had no thoughts, and never had any, of attempting to
restore Protection in the shape of import duties; but he
made magnificent promises of the great things the Government
mean to do for the farmers and owners of land, by a
scheme the nature and details of which he refused to reveal.
All those (comprising almost everybody) who have found
themselves obliged to abandon Corn Laws, and to subscribe
to the Big Loaf doctrine, have nevertheless talked largely
of Protection in the shape of compensation and of justice
to the landed interest by means of fiscal arrangements;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
and this has so far succeeded, that, except in one or two
counties, the farmers have been as rabid against Free Trade
and for Protection as if the Government had never renounced
their old Protectionist principles, and there is no doubt that
they have everywhere supported the Derbyite candidates from
a conviction that they are to derive some great though unexplained
advantage from the Government. This, and the
religious cry, and the utter insensibility of the constituencies
to the insincere and shuffling conduct of the Ministers and
their supporters, have produced the strong party which we
shall see established on the right side of the Chair when
Parliament meets.</p>

<p>There are also a good number of people who have supported
Lord Derby from fear of a Radical alliance between
John Russell and Graham and the Manchester men, and the
dread of their returning to power with a budget of new
Reform Bills, and who really do believe that this Government
is, as it pretends to be, a barrier against revolution.
Indeed the only satisfactory part of this general election
is the undoubted proof it affords of the strength of the Conservative
element in the country, and it is only to be regretted
that it should be found all enlisted on the side of
such a Government as this, and associated with so much of
ignorance and fanaticism. These last qualities, however,
are common to both parties; and if I had ever been impressed
with any popular notions of what is called the good
sense of the people, I should be quite disabused of them
now; for whichever way we turn our eyes, whether towards
those who call themselves Conservative, or those who claim
to be Reformers, we find the same evidence of unfitness to
deal with important political questions, and to exercise an
active influence on public affairs, and on both sides we are
disgusted with the profligate means employed by candidates,
who pander to every sort of popular prejudice, and
in rare instances have the courage and honesty to face
them, and to speak out plain and salutary truths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPRESSION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY.</div>

<p>The only really creditable election is that of Edinburgh,
where Macaulay was elected without solicitation, or his being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
a candidate, although he did not appear at the election,
and the constituency were well aware that his opinions were
not in conformity with theirs on many subjects, especially
on the religious ones, upon which they are particularly hot
and eager. Nowhere else have character or ability availed
against political prejudices and animosities. Distinguished
men have been rejected for mediocrities, by whom it is
discreditable for any great constituency to be represented.
The most conspicuous examples of this incongruity have
been Lewis in Herefordshire, Sir George Grey in Northumberland,
and Cardwell in Liverpool. Pusey was obliged to
retire from Berks, and Buxton was beaten in Essex, victims
of Protectionist ill-humour and revenge. Both were succeeded
by far inferior men, who have no other merit than
those Protectionist longings which they do not pretend
they shall ever have the means of gratifying. The friends
of the late Government and all who abhor this one are of
course infinitely disgusted and disheartened at such a state
of things, having been very confident that the Government
would be in a considerable minority, and that they would
be powerless to go on against a majority, which, though
scattered, would be overwhelming whenever it could be
brought into united action; they are now obliged to perceive
that the Government will be much too strong to be
speedily turned out; and even if this should happen, that
the Tories are too strong to admit of any other Government
being formed with a chance of stability and power.</p>

<p>This state of Parliamentary parties has had the effect of
reviving the resentment of the Liberals against John Russell,
as they attribute to him and his mismanagement the
defeat they have sustained at the election and the present
unpromising condition of the Liberal party. And the wisest
and most moderate men are now only intent on restraining
the impatience of those who would attack the Government
as soon as possible, and are strenuously urging the
policy of abstaining from all violent or vexatious opposition,
and of giving the Ministry full leisure and opportunity
of developing their policy and proposing their intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
measures to the country. This policy will probably be
adopted, for it appears to be the opinion of John Russell
himself that it is adviseable; but there is such a strong feeling
against him that it is impossible to say what amount
of influence he may be disposed or be permitted to exercise
when the principal men of the various sections of opposition
begin to consider the tactics to be adopted. Brooks's
grumbles audibly against Lord John, and there is an evident
indisposition to accept him again as Prime Minister. Fortescue
came to the Duke of Bedford the other day, told him
this feeling was very strong and prevalent, and urged him to
make it known to his brother.</p>

<p>The object of the malcontents is to prevail on Lord
Lansdowne to put himself at the head of the party and the
Government, if one can be made, not objecting to Lord
John's leading the House of Commons. This is also the
object of Palmerston, who would join Lord Lansdowne's
Cabinet, but would not serve <i>under</i> John Russell, though he
would not object to serve <i>with</i> him.<a id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The Duke of Bedford
came here to talk it over with me, saying he did not think
Lord John would kick at this plan, but that Lord Lansdowne
would never consent to it. I told him I did not think Lord
Lansdowne's consent so impossible as he imagined, but of
course he only could or would agree to it upon its being
urged upon him by Lord John himself, and as the only way
in which the Liberal Party could be united and any Government
formed. We agreed, however, and in this Clarendon
strongly concurred, that it would be better not to write to
Lord John on the subject (who is in Scotland), but to wait
till he and his brother meet, when the matter can be talked
over. But even if he should fully assent, it would only get
rid of one difficulty, and I much doubt whether with such a
numerous and compact Ministerial party and such a divided
Opposition, agreeing only in hostility to Derby, and split on
almost every great subject, it would be possible to form any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
other Government, much less one with strong and harmonious
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD DERBY AT GOODWOOD.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;At Goodwood all last week; glorious
weather and the whole thing very enjoyable; a vast deal of
great company&mdash;Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Mecklenburg,
Duke of Parma, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, father of Prince
Edward. Derby was there&mdash;not in his usual uproarious
spirits, chaffing and laughing from morning till night, but
cheerful enough, though more sedate than is his wont. We
had no political talk at all, at least not general talk; but as
the party was mainly Derbyite they communed no doubt
amongst each other. They are by way of being very well
satisfied with the result of the elections, and their adherents
predict a long tenure of office. Derby, half in joke and half
in earnest, talked of something that was to happen in a
year's time, which he said would probably see them out
again. It is not yet admitted as a fact what the gain to
Government is, nor what the relative numbers are, but it
may be taken roughly at about 300 Derbyites, thoroughgoing
supporters; 50 or 60 that cannot be reckoned as
belonging to either party; and the rest divided into various
sections of opposition and greatly at variance with each
other, except in a common sentiment of aversion and determined
hostility to the Government.</p>

<p>George Lewis, whom I saw yesterday, gave me a deplorable
account of the moral and intellectual state of the constituency
of Herefordshire, enough to shake the strongest
faith in popular institutions, and reliance on what is called
the good sense of the people. In Herefordshire the battle
was fought entirely upon the question of Free Trade. There
was no religious element there. He was beaten by the
farmers and the small proprietors, men with small landed
properties, by whom any diminution of rent was severely
felt; and by the clergy, who went against him to a man
because their incomes had likewise suffered by the fall in the
price of grain on which their tithe commutation is calculated.
All these classes are animated with resentment
against Free Traders, and deceived by the vague promises
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
of the Government that some great relief is to be afforded
to them in some unknown shape. The small freeholders
were all for Lewis, and if they had voted for him as they had
promised he would have gained his election; but no sort of
intimidation and violence was spared towards them by the
large farmers, and they were frightened and driven to forfeit
their pledges, and to vote against him. Their ignorance, he
says, is complete. They never see a metropolitan newspaper,
and the very little they read is in the local journals,
which only seem to foster their prejudices and maintain
their delusions. In many instances the voters did not know
whom they were going to vote for, nor even who were the
candidates. They were made to vote against the Free
Traders, and sent to the poll with tickets for the three
Protectionists. Out of all this chaos and confusion, so much
delusion, such ignorance and easily excited bigotry, such
vague and crude political ideas and wishes, the only wonder
is that a House of Commons somehow emerges and presents
itself which is tolerably respectable in character and ability,
and able to discharge its constitutional duties with credit
and efficiency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD LANSDOWNE PROPOSED AS PREMIER.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>August 9th.</i>&mdash;I called on Graham on Friday and found
the Duke of Bedford with him. He was exceedingly dejected
at the state of public affairs and the result of the
elections, which he considered as more favourable to the
Government than he had ever anticipated they would be;
thinks the amount of bribery and violence which have prevailed
has given a great stimulus to the question of Ballot,
for which the desire is rapidly extending, and that it will be
difficult to oppose it. At the same time he thinks the evil
and mischief of the Ballot enormous, and more dangerous in
its democratic tendency than any other measure of reform.
He said he was in constant and very friendly communication
with John Russell, and he considers in the event of a change
of government that no arrangement will be feasible except
placing him at the head of another administration. The
Duke told him there was a scheme afloat to get Lord
Lansdowne to take the chief place, which many of the discontented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
Liberals thought the only plan by which the party
could be kept together, but Graham scouted this as impossible.
This is what Palmerston wants, because it would
remove his difficulty; but Graham thinks it will be impossible
for any real reconciliation to take place between John Russell
and Palmerston, and that there would be so many other
difficulties, especially with Aberdeen, whom the Peelites regard
as their chief, that Palmerston's return to office at
all is out of the question, and he evidently regards as no
improbable contingency a junction between Palmerston and
Derby, which, as we told him, was quite inconsistent with
the language of both Palmerston and Lady Palmerston, who
always talked as if he belonged to the Liberal Party, and
evinced a great dislike and contempt for the Derby Government.</p>

<p>We then talked of the quarrel with America about the
fisheries, which Graham looked upon as very serious, and he
contemplates the possibility of Palmerston, moved by hatred
and rivalry of Aberdeen, making common cause with the
Government and joining them on the pretext of taking up a
national question and fighting a national battle; but neither
the Duke nor I would agree to this being likely. Graham
told us he had had a very friendly correspondence with
Gladstone, to whom he had written to congratulate him on
his election, and he read Gladstone's reply, which was very
cordial and amicable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF COUNT D'ORSAY.</div>

<p>The death of D'Orsay, which took place the other day at
Paris, is a matter not of political, but of some social interest.
Nature had given him powers which might have
raised him to very honourable distinction, and have procured
him every sort of success, if they had been well and
wisely employed, instead of the very reverse. He was extremely
good-looking, very quick, lively, good-natured, and
agreeable, with considerable talent, taste for, and knowledge
of art, and very tolerably well-informed. Few <i>amateurs</i> have
excelled him as a painter and a sculptor, though his merit
was not so great as it appeared, because he constantly got
helped, and his works retouched by eminent artists, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
society he cultivated, and many of whom were his intimate
friends. His early life and connexion with the Blessington
family was enveloped in a sort of half mystery, for it was
never exactly known how his ill-omened marriage was
brought about; but the general notion was, that Lord Blessington
and Lady Blessington were equally in love with
him, and it is certain that his influence over the Earl was
unbounded.<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Whatever his relations may have been with
the rest of the family, he at all events devoted his whole life
to <i>her</i>, and employed all his faculties in making Gore House,
where they resided together for many years, an attractive
and agreeable abode. His extravagance at one period had
plunged him into inextricable difficulties, from which neither
his wife's fortune, a large portion of which was sacrificed,
nor the pecuniary aid of friends on whom he levied frequent
contributions, were sufficient to relieve him, and for some
years he made himself a prisoner at Gore House, and never
stirred beyond its four walls, except on a Sunday, to avoid
being incarcerated in a more irksome confinement. Nothing,
however, damped his gaiety, and he procured the enjoyment
of constant society, and devoted himself assiduously to the
cultivation of his talent for painting and sculpture, for which
he erected a studio in the garden. He was extremely hospitable,
and managed to collect a society which was very
miscellaneous, but included many eminent and remarkable
men of all descriptions, professions, and countries, so that it
was always curious and often entertaining. Foreigners of
all nations were to be met with there, especially exiles and
notabilities of any kind. He was the friend of Louis Napoleon
and the friend of Louis Blanc, both of whom at different
times I met at Gore House. He had a peculiar talent for
drawing people out, and society might have been remarkably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
agreeable there if the lady of the house had contributed
more to make it so. Of course no women ever went there,
except a few who were in some way connected with D'Orsay
and Lady Blessington; and exotic personages, such as
Madame Guiccioli, who lived with them whenever she came
to England. There never was a foreigner who so completely
took root in England as D'Orsay, except perhaps the Russian
Matuscewitz. He spoke and wrote English perfectly, and
he thoroughly understood the country. He was always
ridiculing the crude and absurd notions which his own
countrymen formed of England; they came here, and after
passing a few weeks in scampering about seeing sights, they
fancied they thoroughly understood the genius and the institutions
of the country, and talked with a pretension and vain
complacency which D'Orsay used to treat with excessive
contempt, and lash with unsparing ridicule. He had in fact
become thoroughly English in tastes, habits and pursuits;
his antecedent life, his connexion with Lady Blessington,
and the vague but prevalent notion of his profligate and
immoral character, made it impossible for him to obtain admission
into the best society, but he managed to gather
about him a miscellaneous but numerous assemblage of
personages not fastidious, or troubled by any scruples of a
refined morality, which made Gore House a considerable
social notability in its way. Lyndhurst and Brougham
were constant guests; the Bulwers, Landseer, Macready, all
authors, artists, and men eminent in any liberal profession,
mixed with strangers of every country and colour; and
D'Orsay's fashionable associates made the house a very gay
and often agreeable resort. Whatever his faults may have
been, and his necessities made him unscrupulous and indelicate
about money matters, he was very obliging, good-natured,
and <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="helpful">serviable</i>; partly from vanity and ostentation,
but also in great measure from humane motives he was
always putting himself forward to promote works of charity
and beneficence, and he exerted all the influence he possessed,
which was not inconsiderable, to assist distressed
genius and merit in every class. He was very anti-Orleanist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
during the reign of Louis Philippe, and though his connexions
were Legitimist, his personal sympathies were enlisted
on the side of Louis Napoleon, with whom he had
considerable intimacy here, and whose future greatness he
always anticipated and predicted. When the derangement
of Lady Blessington's affairs broke up the establishment at
Gore House, and compelled her to migrate to Paris, D'Orsay
naturally expected that the elevation of Louis Napoleon
would lead to some good appointment for himself, and he no
doubt was deeply mortified at not obtaining any, and became
a <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="rebel">frondeur</i> in consequence. It was, however, understood
that the President wished to give him a mission, and he
certainly was very near being made Minister at Hanover,
but that the French Ministers would not consent to it. He
was unpopular in France and ill-looked upon, in consequence
of having quitted the army when ordered on active service,
in what was considered a discreditable manner, and consequently
his social position at Paris was not near so good
as that which he enjoyed in England, though it was of the
same description, as he lived chiefly with authors, artists,
and actors, or rather actresses; but a short time ago, when
the President was become omnipotent and could dispense
his patronage and his favours as he pleased, he created a
place for D'Orsay connected with the Department of the
Fine Arts, which exactly suited his taste, and would have
made the rest of his life easy, if he had continued to live,
and his patron continued to reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIVISION IN THE LIBERAL PARTY.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>August 11th.</i>&mdash;A great deal of communication has been
taking place between the Duke of Bedford, Clarendon, and
Graham, who are all in town, and between them, by correspondence,
and John Russell, Lansdowne, Grey, and others;
the result of the whole exhibiting a deplorable state of disunion
and disorganisation in the Liberal party, and the
prospect of enormous and apparently irreconcilable difficulties
when they come together. John Russell and Graham
are upon very intimate and cordial terms, and so are Lord
John and Aberdeen. The Whigs are divided, some being
entirely for John Russell, while others, still resenting his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
past conduct, and many personally dissatisfied with him,
are strongly opposed to his being again Prime Minister.
The Peelites, Graham thinks, would not consent to join a
government of which he was to be at the head. The object
of Fortescue and others is to reconstitute the Whig party
with additions, and Lansdowne at the head of it. In the
course of a very friendly and frank correspondence Graham
has lately intimated to Lord John the objections that might
be raised in certain quarters to his being again Prime
Minister, to which he responded without any anger, but said
he had long ago made up his mind not to belong to any
Government unless he was replaced in his post, and that he
should consider it 'a degradation' to accept any other; but
if a Liberal Government was formed under another chief he
would give it every aid in his power. Graham combated
the idea of its being any degradation to take another office,
and give way to another chief, if circumstances imperatively
demanded such a sacrifice of him, and said it could be no
degradation to him to be what Mr. Fox was in 1806, Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, and leader of the House of Commons.
The Duke of Bedford wrote to Lord John on the
same topic, and told him what he had heard from different
quarters; but Lord John took it ill, and wrote a much crosser
letter than he did to Graham, so that it is evident the question
of headship will itself be very difficult to arrange.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of Reform in Parliament. To
this John Russell is entirely and irrevocably committed, and
Graham thinks he can return to office on no other terms,
while Lansdowne and several of the leading Whigs are
vehemently opposed to it, and the former would certainly
not accept the office of Premier, probably not join the Government
at all, except on an understanding that there
should be no Reform at all, or a measure infinitely less than
John Russell is committed to. Then Palmerston is against
Reform, and the Peelites are divided or undecided about it.
Newcastle would go with John Russell and be a Reformer;
Gladstone and Sidney Herbert might probably go the other
way. The Whig party are divided also, and I own I do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
not see how any other Government could by possibility be
formed which could obtain Liberal support enough to stand,
and yet agree on this question. In the event of a change
another election would be indispensably necessary; and if
the question of Reform was to be the one put before the
country for its decision, it is as likely as not that the country
would decide against it. Most assuredly at the recent election
'Reform' found no very extensive favour among the
constituencies, and a good deal of Derby's popularity arose
from the notion that his is a Conservative Government, and
a barrier against revolutionary measures. At this moment,
while there is a general prosperity and content, the country
is in a Conservative humour, and does not wish for organic
changes, nor will it wish for any such until pressure or distress
of some sort shall occur, when it might be excited and
deluded into a desire for novelties. What public opinion
requires is reform of the law, and those amendments of an
administrative kind which lead to practical results intelligible
to all, and these the Derby Government may give
the people, and will do so if they are wise. This Government
is certainly on the whole rather popular than not,
and its ambiguous and insincere conduct has failed to discredit
it with those who were favourable to its advent to
power. It has got the whole body of the agriculturists, all
the Church, and a large proportion of the wealthy middle
classes on its side, at least 300 devoted adherents in the
House of Commons, and an Opposition in a state of disunion,
without a leader, and full of personal antipathies,
and incompatible objects, opinions and pretensions. A more
hopeless fix I never recollect. If this Government were
better composed, and its members had more experience and
ability, and higher principles, it would have little difficulty
in maintaining itself against such a discordant Opposition;
but so far as one can judge, it seems probable that they will
create great reverses for themselves by their blunders, and
by the disgust which their dishonesty has given, and will
give, to some of the more consistent or more obstinate of
their own friends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GRANBY'S CONSISTENCY.</div>

<p>The Duke of Rutland confided to the Duke of Bedford
the other day that he is very uneasy about Granby, who is
extremely dissatisfied with the course the Government is
taking, and much inclined to give utterance to his feelings
and opinions. His father has done his best to pacify him,
but finds him very difficult to move. The Duke of Rutland
remonstrated that he would seriously injure the Government
he was attached to, and his own brother, who was a member
of it; to which he replied he would not abstain from attacking
his own brother if he chose to desert the principles he
had always maintained. The Duke of Bedford told the
Duke of Rutland he thought Granby's feelings did him
great credit; that though his conclusions were unsound,
his conscientious adherence to the principles he had always
avowed, and still maintained, were very honourable to him,
and so he should tell him when he saw him. This schism
is important, and if they cannot muzzle Granby will prove
very injurious to the Government; but I suppose they will
talk him over before Parliament meets, as they have done
so many others. Meanwhile in the midst of such confusion
and difficulty as the Liberal cause is involved in, John Russell
has taken one step towards clearing the way, for he has
requested Aberdeen to communicate with Gladstone, Newcastle,
and Sidney Herbert, and ascertain what their disposition
is concerning a junction, and what their views are.
This may probably lead to something one way or another.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;I went to Bolton Abbey for two days before
York races, then to Nun Appleton for them; since that to
Brocket, and back to town. Found nothing new except a
letter from John Russell to Clarendon, the contents of which
greatly surprised Clarendon and the Duke of Bedford, as
he said in reference to Reform that he was not disposed to
insist on disfranchisement, and certainly should not propose
it against the opinion and wishes of many of his friends.
For this moderation and concession they were not prepared.
The great question for the Liberal party to decide now is,
whether they shall propose any amendment to the Address,
and John Russell and Charles Wood both think this should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
not be done without absolute necessity, but that if anything
is said in the Queen's Speech indicative of Protectionist intentions,
or any slur thrown on Free Trade, then they cannot
avoid some affirmative expression of their own principles
and of the benefits resulting from them; but nothing will be
decided on till Parliament meets and they know what Derby
is going to do. They have made Granby Lord Lieutenant
of Lincolnshire, which will probably have the effect of
stopping his mouth, if it does not remove his discontent.</p>

<p>Lord Cowley has been to me to consult me about a
communication he has had from Lord Derby relating to his
proxy, which Derby has desired to have placed in his hands.
Cowley, who accepted the post at Paris from the late Government
on the express condition that it should not be a political
appointment, he not being bound to support them in
the House of Lords, justly thinks it would be inconsistent
with that understanding if he were now to join this Government
and give them his proxy, and he has declined to do
so. He had an interview with Derby, and told him all
this. Derby took it ill, drew up and said he thought this
a different case, and that he ought to give him the proxy.
He added that he was placed in a very difficult position,
not even knowing that he had a majority in the House of
Lords, and as he considered this the last chance of establishing
a Conservative Government in this country he felt
bound to make every exertion to maintain himself in power,
and he intimated as much as that on his consent to give his
proxy would depend his retaining the Embassy. Cowley
and I concocted a letter to Derby, in which he gave his
reasons for declining to do this, but that he would place it
in the Duke of Wellington's hands. This is not of much
importance; but it evinces, from Derby's tone as well as
conduct, a sense of insecurity and difficulty as to his position
greater than I thought he felt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>Mellish of the Foreign Office told me the other day that
Lord Malmesbury had one very good quality, firmness; that
his firmness brought about the settlement of the Danish
Question, and in the office he was evidently resolved to maintain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
his own authority.  He said he had seen Malmesbury
put down&mdash;&mdash;with great tact, when the other showed a
disposition to take upon himself. The fact is, he is not an
incapable man at all, though inexperienced to the greatest
degree.</p>

<p class="entry"><i>August 31st.</i>&mdash;To Brocket with Clarendon on Saturday,
and came back yesterday. Before I went, I saw Graham,
and found him fully persuaded that a change is about
to take place in the Government, which, if it occurs, he
fancies he has indirectly been instrumental in bringing
about. He said that Goulburn came to him the other day
and told him Walpole, who is a great friend of Goulburn's,
is very sick of his office, and annoyed at the mess he has
got into about the Militia; that he wanted very much to be
Solicitor-General originally, and that he now finds himself
thrown out of his profession of the law, and holding a
situation which he may lose any day. Graham said, Why
does not he take the vacant Vice-Chancellorship? and Derby
may offer the Home Secretaryship to Palmerston, who is the
man (if any can) to get them out of the Militia difficulty.
Goulburn seemed to catch at this suggestion, and Graham
has no doubt he suggested it to Walpole; and he has entirely
persuaded himself that the arrangement will take place.
He says Disraeli would concede the lead to Palmerston, and
as Palmerston would only join on Protection being formally
abandoned, it would give Derby a capital opportunity of
giving it up and of satisfying his party by giving them
Palmerston, and with him a secure tenure of office. He
says, if Palmerston joined, Gladstone would probably follow,
and then they would have a strong Government; all the
Conservatives opposed to Reform would rally round it, and
they would be able to go on. Clarendon and I talked it
over, and without arriving at Graham's conclusions, we
both agreed that this arrangement was not improbable. It
seems to be the interest both of Derby and Palmerston to
make it; and if Protection should be given up, there appears
no difference between them, for Palmerston is a strenuous
Anti-Reformer. It seems John Russell has written to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
Graham in the same terms as to Clarendon, and said he
would not propose any disfranchisement without the assent
of his Whig friends. Graham sent him a letter of Joe
Parke's in which that worthy said the Radicals were well
disposed towards Lord John, and he sketched the sort of
Reform Bill that ought to be proposed, to which Lord John
wrote rather a lofty answer, and in a more peremptory
style than Graham liked. The truth is he is in this fix,
that he cannot do much without offending the Whigs, nor
little without alienating the Radicals; nor do I see how this
difficulty is to be got over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</div>

<p class="entry"><i>London, September 18th.</i>&mdash;It was at Doncaster on Wednesday
morning last that I heard of the Duke of Wellington's
death, which at first nobody believed, but they speedily
telegraphed to London, and the answer proved that the
report was correct. Doncaster was probably the only place
in the kingdom where the sensation caused by this event
was not absorbing and profound; but there, on the morning
of the St. Leger, most people were too much occupied with
their own concerns to bestow much thought or lamentation
on this great national loss. Everywhere else the excitement
and regret have been unexampled, and the press has been
admirable, especially the 'Times,' the biographical notice
and article in which paper were both composed many months
ago, and shown to me. Indeed the notices of the Duke and
the characters drawn of him have been so able and elaborate
in all the newspapers, that they leave little or nothing to be
said. Still, there were minute traits of character and peculiarities
about the Duke which it was impossible for mere
public writers and men personally unacquainted with him to
seize, but the knowledge and appreciation of which are necessary
in order to form a just and complete conception of the
man. In spite of some foibles and faults, he was, beyond all
doubt, a very great man&mdash;the only great man of the present
time&mdash;and comparable, in point of greatness, to the most
eminent of those who have lived before him. His greatness
was the result of a few striking qualities&mdash;a perfect simplicity
of character without a particle of vanity or conceit, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
with a thorough and strenuous self-reliance, a severe truthfulness,
never misled by fancy or exaggeration, and an ever-abiding
sense of duty and obligation which made him the
humblest of citizens and most obedient of subjects. The
Crown never possessed a more faithful, devoted, and disinterested
subject. Without personal attachment to any of
the monarchs whom he served, and fully understanding and
appreciating their individual merits and demerits, he alike
reverenced their great office in the persons of each of them,
and would at any time have sacrificed his ease, his fortune,
or his life, to serve the Sovereign and the State. Passing
almost his whole life in command and authority, and regarded
with universal deference and submission, his head
was never turned by the exalted position he occupied, and
there was no duty, however humble, he would not have been
ready to undertake at the bidding of his lawful superiors,
whose behests he would never have hesitated to obey. Notwithstanding
his age and his diminished strength, he would
most assuredly have gone anywhere and have accepted any
post in which his personal assistance might have been
essential to the safety or advantage of the realm. He had
more pride in obeying than in commanding, and he never
for a moment considered that his great position and elevation
above all other subjects released him from the same
obligation which the humblest of them acknowledged. He
was utterly devoid of personal and selfish ambition, and
there never was a man whose greatness was so <i>thrust</i> upon
him. It was in this dispassionate unselfishness, and sense
of duty and moral obligation, that he was so superior to
Napoleon Bonaparte, who, with more genius and fertility of
invention, was the slave of his own passions, unacquainted
with moral restraint, indifferent to the well-being and happiness
of his fellow-creatures; and who in pursuit of any
objects at which his mind grasped trampled under foot
without remorse or pity all divine and human laws, and bore
down every obstacle and scorned every consideration which
opposed themselves to his absolute and despotic will. The
Duke was a good-natured, but not an amiable man; he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
no tenderness in his disposition, and never evinced much
affection for any of his relations. His nature was hard, and
he does not appear to have had any real affection for anybody,
man or woman, during the latter years of his life,
since the death of Mrs. Arbuthnot, to whom he probably
was attached, and in whom he certainly confided. Domestic
enjoyment he never possessed, and, as his wife was intolerable
to him, though he always kept on decent terms with
her, at least, ostensibly, he sought the pleasure of women's
society in a variety of capricious <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaisons</i>, from which his age
took off all scandal: these he took up or laid aside and
changed as fancy and inclination prompted him. His intimate
friends and adherents used to smile at these senile
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="passing fads">engouements</i>, but sometimes had to regret the ridicule to
which they would have exposed him if a general reverence
and regard had not made him a privileged person, and permitted
him to do what no other man could have done with
impunity. In his younger days he was extremely addicted
to gallantry, and had great success with women, of whom
one in Spain gained great influence over him, and his passion
for whom very nearly involved him in serious difficulties.
His other ladies did little more than amuse his idle hours
and subserve his social habits, and with most of them his
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="connections">liaisons</i> were certainly very innocent. He had been very
fond of Grassini, and the successful lover of some women of
fashion, whose weaknesses have never been known, though
perhaps suspected. These habits of female intimacy and
gossip led him to take a great interest in a thousand petty
affairs, in which he delighted to be mixed up and consulted.
He was always ready to enter into any personal matters,
intrigues, or quarrels, political or social difficulties, and to
give his advice, which generally (though not invariably) was
very sound and good; but latterly he became morose and inaccessible,
and cursed and swore at the people who sought
to approach him, even on the most serious and necessary
occasions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</div>

<p>Although the Duke's mind was still very vigorous, and
he wrote very good papers on the various subjects which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
were submitted for his judgement and opinion, his prejudices
had become so much stronger and more unassailable,
that he gave great annoyance and a good deal of difficulty
to the Ministers who had to transact business with him. He
was opposed to almost every sort of change and reform in
the military administration, and it was a task of no small
difficulty to steer between the exigencies of public opinion
and his objections and resistance. As it was always
deemed an object to keep him in good humour, and many
considerations forbade anything like a dissension with him, or
an appeal against him to the public, the late Ministers often
acted, or refrained from acting, in deference to his opinions
and against their own, and took on themselves all the responsibility
of maintaining his views and measures, even
when they thought he was wrong. His habits were latterly
very solitary, and after the death of Arbuthnot he had no
intimacy with any one, nor any friend to whom he could
talk freely and confidentially. As long as Arbuthnot lived
he confided everything to him, and those who wished to
communicate with the Duke almost always did so through
him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the friendly and eulogistic terms in
which he spoke of Sir Robert Peel just after his death, it is
very certain that the Duke disliked him, and during the
latter part of their Administration he seldom had any
communication with Peel except such as passed through
Arbuthnot. The Duke deeply resented, and I believe never
heartily forgave, Peel's refusal to have anything to do with
the Administration he so unwisely undertook to form on
Lord Grey's sudden resignation in 1832, in the middle of
the Reform contest; but this did not prevent his advising
King William to make Peel Prime Minister, and taking
office under him in 1835, and again in 1841. They acted
together very harmoniously during Peel's Administration,
but the Duke (though he sided with Sir Robert when
the schism took place) in his heart bitterly lamented and
disapproved his course about the Repeal of the Corn Laws,
not so much from aversion to Free Trade as because it produced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
a fresh and final break-up of the Conservative party,
which he considered the greatest evil which could befall the
country. But whatever may have been his real sentiments
with regard to various public men, he never allowed any
partialities or antipathies to appear in his manner or
behaviour towards them, and he was always courteous,
friendly, and accessible to all, especially those in office, who
had recourse to him for his advice and opinion. He had all
his life been long accustomed to be consulted, and he certainly
liked it till the last, and was pleased with the marks
of deference and attention which were continually paid to
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE'S GENEROSITY AND INDEPENDENCE.</div>

<p>His position was eminently singular and exceptional,
something between the Royal Family and other subjects.
He was treated with greater respect than any individual not
of Royal birth, and the whole Royal Family admitted him
to a peculiar and exclusive familiarity and intimacy in their
intercourse with him, which, while he took it in the easiest
manner, and as if naturally due to him, he never abused or
presumed upon. No man was more respectful or deferential
towards the Sovereign and other Royal personages, but at
the same time he always gave them his opinions and counsels
with perfect frankness and sincerity, and never condescended
to modify them to suit their prejudices or wishes.
Upon every occasion of difficulty, public or private, he was
always appealed to, and he was always ready to come forward
and give his assistance and advice in his characteristic,
plain, and straightforward manner. If he had written his
own memoirs, he might have given to the world the most
curious history of his own times that ever was composed, but
he was the last man to deal in autobiography. One of his
peculiarities was never to tell anybody where he was going,
and when my brother or his own sons wished to be acquainted
with his intentions, they were obliged to apply to the housekeeper,
to whom he was in the habit of making them known,
and nobody ever dared to ask him any questions on the subject.
He was profuse but careless and indiscriminating in
his charities, and consequently he was continually imposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
upon, especially by people who pretended to have served
under him, or to be the descendants or connexions of those
who had, and it was very difficult to restrain his disposition
to send money to every applicant who approached him under
that pretence. Partly from a lofty feeling of independence
and disinterestedness, and partly from indifference, he was
a very bad patron to his relations and adherents, and never
would make any applications for their benefit. The consequence
was that he was not an object of affection, even to
those who looked up to him with profound veneration and
respect. He held popularity in great contempt, and never
seemed touched or pleased at the manifestations of popular
admiration and attachment of which he was the object.
Whenever he appeared in public he was always surrounded
by crowds of people, and when he walked abroad
everybody who met him saluted him; but he never seemed
to notice the curiosity or the civilities which his presence
elicited.

<h3 id="Appendix_A">APPENDIX A.</h3>

<p class="center">LETTER ON THE DEFENCES OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1848, on the eve of the great convulsion caused
by the French Revolution of February, Mr. Cobden delivered a
speech in Manchester in which he ridiculed armaments and attacked
the Duke of Wellington for his recent attempt to call public attention
to the defences of the country. This led Mr. Greville to address
the following letter to Mr. Cobden, in the 'Times' of February 2,
1848:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have read with regret your recent speech at Manchester, more
especially your comments on the Duke of Wellington's letter to Sir John
Burgoyne, which are as unworthy of yourself as they are unjust and disrespectful
to that illustrious person. It is fit that the real facts concerning
that letter and its publication should be made known to the world, for the
exaggerations and misrepresentations which have grown out of it are both
injurious to the Duke of Wellington, and the source of much mischief and
error in respect to the vexed question of national defence.</p>

<p>The letter (which is now above a year old) was a reply to one addressed
by Sir John Burgoyne to his Grace upon the defence of the country. It was
an exposition of the Duke's views and opinions, written, not merely without
the least notion of its ever being published, but imparted confidentially, and (as
I believe) without any idea that the contents of it would ever be divulged;
but, by a most extraordinary and reprehensible breach of propriety and
prudence, copies were taken of this letter, which were carelessly distributed,
and almost hawked about the world. Curiosity and interest soon became
excited. These copies were greedily sought, and particularly by those who
subscribe to the Duke's opinions on the subject. Allusions and extracts first
made their appearance in a newspaper, and at length the letter was published
<i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="in full">in extenso</i>, without the consent or knowledge, and (as those who best know
his sentiments affirm) very much to the annoyance and displeasure of the
Duke. It is a great mistake to deal with this letter as if it were a formal
official document, taken out of a Blue Book. No man knows better than the
Duke of Wellington the difference between what is desirable and what is
practicable. In writing confidentially to his military colleague, he naturally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
imparted to him what he thought it would be expedient to do; but, in
dealing practically with such a subject, we may be sure that he never loses
sight of the various complex considerations which the Government must
look to, and of the necessity of combining the military exigencies with the
political and financial circumstances of the country.</p>

<p>In explaining that the Duke's letter was not intended for publication, I
am far from meaning to admit that the letter itself requires any apology,
though the same cannot be said of the comments you have thought fit to
make upon it; you misrepresented both its matter and its spirit, and all who
respect your character and admire your abilities must have lamented to hear
you treat the Duke himself with a contumely unbecoming in the mouth of
any one, but especially so in that of a man with the high reputation which
you deservedly enjoy. In vain, too, do we look in your speech for any of
that vigorous reasoning with which you fought the great battle of Free Trade.
Had you not sustained that cause with more forcible arguments than you have
produced on the present occasion, you would never have obtained a European
celebrity, and the flag might still be flying on the citadel of Protection.</p>

<p>You, and those who think with you, appear to rely mainly on two
propositions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That a war with France is next to impossible; so improbable as
to be not worth providing against.</p>

<p>2. That, in case of war, our naval superiority will always protect us
from invasion or insult.</p>

<p>So far as I can find out, the only reasons and arguments by which you
maintain the former of these propositions are your own demonstration that all
nations would do well and wisely to turn their swords into ploughshares, and
for the future to interchange merchandise instead of blows, and the fact that
some French Free Traders have been making speeches marvellously resembling
your own, and abounding with the same wholesome truths. The recommendations
of Messrs. Visinet and Crémieux, as well as your own, are
unquestionably replete with wisdom, and happy would it be if all the world
would embrace them; if, besides such admirable speeches, we could see any
essential reduction in the French tariff, or if the efforts of the French Opposition
were seriously directed to promote the cause of commercial reform; but
although you, Sir, in your recent tour throughout Europe, have been everywhere
received with all the honour which is justly due to you, and though
you have abundantly scattered the seeds of sound information and advice,
we have yet to learn that any one country that you have visited, or any one
Government with which you communicated, has put your lessons in practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFENCES OF THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>But while we are invited to accept such speculative reasoning as conclusive
proof of the inviolability of peace, unfortunately one page of very recent
history sweeps away the whole concatenation of your logic, the narration of
which may produce something both of reflexion and anticipation. I admit
that a war with France is not a probable event, but the same thing might
have been said (perhaps with more truth) in 1844. The present Government,
indeed, is no less pacifically inclined than the last, but it is well known
that the relations of the two countries are by no means so intimate now as
they were at the former period; and if, by any unhappy accident, differences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
should now occur, the same facilities for reconciliation and adjustment might
not be forthcoming. And yet, in 1844, with the <i class="grn" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i> in full force,
when M. Guizot and Lord Aberdeen were knit together by the closest ties
of personal as well as diplomatic friendship, we suddenly found ourselves on
the very brink of war. Everybody must remember the Tahiti affair, but
many may have forgotten or never known its momentous details. The
English Government considered itself aggrieved by France, and demanded
reparation for the alleged wrong. The French Minister refused to give us
the full measure of satisfaction that our honour required. A serious, and for
a long time a fruitless discussion ensued between the two Governments,
pending which an adjournment of the two Houses of Parliament took place.
About a month afterwards (in the beginning of September) they met again.
The day was fixed for the prorogation, and still the dispute with France was
unsettled. At this crisis, and at the eleventh hour, a last offer was made by
the French Government. There was barely time to consider it. The Cabinet
was assembled for that purpose on the afternoon of the 4th. On the result
of its deliberations the question of peace or war depended. There was very
little to spare, for the maximum which M. Guizot could bring himself to offer
was the minimum that we could with honour accept. However, the proposal
was accepted, and on the following day the speech from the Throne announced
that the reconciliation was effected, but in terms which showed the magnitude
of the danger from which the world had escaped. 'Her Majesty,' it
ran, 'has recently been engaged in discussions with the Government of
the King of the French on events <i>calculated to interrupt the good understanding
and friendly relations between this country and France</i>; you will
rejoice to learn that, by the spirit of justice and moderation which has
animated the two Governments, <i>this danger is now happily averted</i>.' The
storm blew over, the Funds rose, and the country (slightly ruffled) relapsed
into its ordinary state of security and repose. For some time before this
incident, the Duke of Wellington had been urging the Government to make
themselves stronger, and our naval force had been considerably increased.
But it is not surprising that what had recently occurred, and the narrow
escape we had had of being actually at war, should have made the Duke
still more anxiously alive to the situation in which the country would have
been placed if a rupture had unhappily taken place. He knew that the risks
to which it was exposed were incalculably great. He knew that, in spite
of all the difficulties we could interpose, it was far from <i>impossible</i> for an
able and active enemy to inflict upon us, unprepared as we were, a disastrous,
and a dishonourable blow. The spirit and patriotism of the warrior and
the statesman rose up within him at the degrading thought, and from that
moment he has never ceased to urge the Government of the day to place the
country as soon as possible in a proper posture of defence; not, as it has been
falsely and foolishly asserted, to prepare in peace for the last extremity, and
incur the full cost of war, but, by making our moderate establishments really
efficient, and adopting those defensive precautions which his great sagacity
and profound knowledge of the art of war enabled him to suggest, to place
the British Islands in a state of security against any sudden attack. And
for thus contemplating the possibility of a catastrophe, which all but happened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
not four years ago, and for warning his countrymen against the
danger, and showing them how to avert it, he is held up to the derision of a
great assembly as a mischievous dotard, whose age is his only excuse.
Having thrust aside the Duke of Wellington, you consistently proceeded
in your speech to inform your audience that of such questions as the probability
of peace or war, questions depending on various complex and secret
operations of international policy, 'merchants and manufacturers, shopkeepers,
operatives&mdash;ay, and calico printers,' are the most competent judges. Far be
it from me to speak of these classes with the contempt with which you have
treated the Duke and all others who defer to his opinions. They are entitled
to respect, for they constitute a large part of the intelligence of the nation.
Amongst them may be found silly and conceited persons, ready to swallow
such flattery as you have condescended to tickle them with, but I believe
they are, for the most part, men of sober and robust minds, who will not be
misled by such fallacious compliments, and form a juster estimate of their
own capacities, and the matters on which their habits, pursuits, and education
render them really competent to decide. I think I have shown that
war is not a contingency so utterly improbable as you would have the
English public believe, and that those who contemplate the possibility of
such a calamity are not necessarily the dotards, cowards, and fools, that you
represent them. I am satisfied that the Sovereigns, the Ministers, the Parliaments,
and the people of both countries desire the maintenance of peace.
But what can insure us against future Pritchards, and D'Aubignés, and
Bruats? Unforeseen accidents may beget untoward events, and the sparks
of a fortuitous collision falling on some combustible matter may produce an
explosion of national resentment or pride which no moderation and wisdom
may be sufficient to extinguish. We have been taught to believe that the
life of the French King is Europe's best security for the continuation of
peace. Time is rapidly stealing away that security from us; and who can
say when that wise head and steady hand shall be withdrawn, how long the
elements of discord and confusion will be prevented from breaking loose?
Nothing is more remarkable than the exaggeration which has marked the
whole course of opposition to the plans of national defence. Their advocates,
the Duke of Wellington at the head of them, are taunted with the
folly of proposing a war establishment in a time of profound peace. Do those
critics know what it is in contemplation to propose now, and what preparations
were made when an invasion was really apprehended? The present
purpose is to replenish our empty arsenals, add about 2,000 men to the
artillery, and gradually (by 10,000 men at a time) to call out and discipline
the Militia; these, together with the completion of the fortifications already
in progress, are understood to be the defensive and precautionary measures
which Parliament will be invited to sanction, and against which such a
clamour is raised. Look at what was done in 1803 and 1804, when war was
about to break out, and the camp of Boulogne was in process of formation.
To encounter the army of 150,000 men which Napoleon was marshalling on
the opposite coast, we had <i>in these islands</i> 650,000 men in arms: there were
130,000 Regulars, 110,000 Militia, and above 400,000 Volunteers. And
three years later, when all dread of invasion had vanished, when the navies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
of France had been utterly destroyed, our forces <i>in England</i> were not less
than 200,000 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFENCES OF THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>That our naval superiority must always be our chief reliance is undoubtedly
true; but here, again, we have history against speculation, and
we may look to the past for instruction as to the future. In 1796 nothing
but storms and tempests prevented Hoche's expedition from accomplishing
the invasion of Ireland or of England, if the French had preferred such an
attempt. The events of that period have been thus recorded by Mr. Alison
and Mr. James:&mdash;'The results of the expedition,' says the former, 'were
pregnant with important instruction to both countries: to the French as demonstrating
the extraordinary risks which attend a maritime expedition, the
small number of forces which can be embarked on board, even of a great
fleet, and the unforeseen disasters which frequently on that element defeat
the best concerted enterprise; to the English, as showing that the empire
of the seas does not always afford security against invasion; that, in the
face of superior maritime forces, her possessions had been for sixteen days at
the mercy of the enemy, and that neither the skill of her sailors nor the
valour of her armies, but the fury of the elements, had saved them from
danger in the most vulnerable point of her dominions. While these considerations
are fitted to abate the confidence of invasion, they are calculated
to weaken our own confidence in naval superiority, and to demonstrate that
the only basis on which certain reliance can be placed, even in an insular
Power, is a well-disciplined army and the patriotism of its own subjects.'
Mr. James says:&mdash;'That a succession of storms, such as those with which
the British Channel was visited, should disperse an encumbered and ill-manned
French fleet ought not to excite surprise, but that during the three
or four weeks that the ships of this fleet were traversing the English and
Irish Channels in every direction, neither of the two British fleets appointed
to look after them should have succeeded in capturing a single ship, may
certainly be noted down as an extraordinary circumstance.' Steam has now
made a great revolution in naval as well as social affairs; but though, in the
long run, this country is more likely to profit by it than France, it is incontestable
that the accidents and unforeseen circumstances of modern warfare
render this country more vulnerable than it was under the old system. The
general arguments have, however, been so amply and so ably stated in publications
without end, that it would be superfluous to say more on the reality
of the danger, and the wisdom of making adequate provision to meet it. But
it is hard for any man who cares for the dignity or safety of his country, and
who honours its greatest citizen and patriot, to endure in silence such a
speech as you have lately delivered. You have acquired great influence over
vast multitudes of men; you may safely guide or mischievously mislead a
large amount of public opinion, and those who, from the vigour and intelligence
of your past career, entertained sanguine expectations of your future
usefulness as a public man, must feel deep disappointment and sorrow at the
very different prospect held out by your recent display.</p>

<p class="center">LETTER ON THE ANTI-PAPAL AGITATION.</p>

<p>The following is the letter signed 'Carolus' which Mr. Greville addressed
to the 'Times' on the subject of the Protestant Agitation,
on December 9, 1850, which is referred to in the text:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the 'Times.'</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANTI-PAPAL AGITATION.</div>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I am one of those who think we have had enough, and more than
enough, of anti-Papal agitation. All the good it can produce has been
achieved, while the evil is still increasing. The good, which I do not underrate,
is a manifestation of the strong and universal attachment of the people
of this country to the Protestant religion. The evil, the revival of sectarian
animosities, and of that intolerant zeal so alien to the true spirit of Christianity,
and which has ever been the bane and the torment of every country
in which it has prevailed. I refrain from commenting upon the harangues
and addresses which for weeks past have been resounding through the
country and filling your columns, and I only hope that in all Europe nobody
reads these effusions but ourselves, for they will not exalt our national reputation.
It may be a vain attempt to sprinkle some drops of reason and
remonstrance upon the raging furnace of popular excitement; but, like everything
in this world, abuse and ridicule of the Pope and railing against the
Roman Catholic religion must at last come to an end. When all this fury
has exhausted itself, and people get tired of reading or of hearing the same
stale repetitions, they will begin to take a more sober and practical view of
the case, and to consider what this mountain in labour is eventually to produce.
We shall assuredly look exceedingly foolish if all the hubbub should
turn out to have been made without some definite, reasonable, and, moreover,
attainable object; and yet we appear to be in imminent danger of finding
ourselves in this perplexing and mortifying predicament. We cry out that
an insult has been offered by the Pope to the English Crown and nation;
that the ecclesiastical constitution which he has promulgated is illegal or
unconstitutional, and that it shall not be endured. When the Queen of
England is insulted, or her subjects are injured by any foreign Power, she
demands redress, and, failing to obtain it, she exacts it by her armies and
her fleets. Are we to hold the Pope in his temporal capacity responsible for
his merely spiritual acts, and deal with him by demands and threats, and by
armaments to enforce them? I apprehend that no such extreme measures
will be adopted. How, then, are we to deal with a Power over which we
can have no control, whose authority is purely spiritual, while the visible
signs of its exercise are only to be found in a voluntary obedience which no
laws can reach and no Governments can prevent? Your statutes will have
no more effect at the Vatican than Papal bulls in Westminster Hall. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
cannot restrain the Pope from elaborating his ecclesiastical policy here, and
all the lawyers in England would fail in devising prohibitory laws as to
spiritual matters which the objects of them could not find means to evade.
Cardinal Wiseman has said with truth that England could not complain of
being taken by surprise. More than two years ago it was no secret that
such measures were in contemplation. They were discussed not only in the
press, but in the House of Commons; and on one occasion Lord John
Russell made a speech, which was so replete with wisdom and truth, and so
exactly applicable to the present occasion and to all that is passing around
us, that it deserves the most attentive and general consideration. On
August 17, 1848, in a debate on the Diplomatic Relations with Rome Bill,
Sir Robert Inglis, after declaring that he had no objection to call Dr.
Wiseman a bishop, but objected to call him Archbishop of Westminster,
put certain questions with regard to the appointment of archbishops and
bishops in this country without the consent of its sovereign, to which the
Prime Minister replied in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I do not know that the Pope has authorised in any way by any authority
that he may have the creation of archbishoprics and bishoprics with
dioceses in England; but certainly I have not given my consent, nor should
I give my consent if I were asked to do so, to any such formation of dioceses.
With regard to spiritual authority, the honourable gentleman must see,
when he alludes to other States in Europe, that whatever control is to be
obtained over the spiritual authority of the Pope can only be obtained by
agreement for that end. You must either give certain advantages to the
Roman Catholic religion, and obtain from the Pope certain other advantages
in return, among which you must stipulate that the Pope shall not create
any dioceses in England without the consent of the Queen; or, on the other
hand, you must say you will have nothing to do with arrangements of that
kind, that you will not consent in any way to give any authority to the
Roman Catholic religion in England. <i>But then you must leave the spiritual
authority of the Pope entirely unfettered. You cannot bind the Pope's
spiritual influence unless you have some agreement....</i> But though you
may prevent any spiritual authority being exercised by the Pope by law,
yet there is no provision, no law my honourable friend could frame that
would deprive the Pope of that influence that is merely exercised over the
mind, or that could preclude him from giving advice to those who choose to
attend to such advice. It is quite obvious that you cannot by any means or
authority prevent the Pope from communicating with the Catholics of this
country. You may try to prevent such communication from being open,
but I think it would be very foolish if you took any means of great vigour
and energy for that purpose. If it is not open, it will be secret. So long
as there are Roman Catholics in this country, and so long as they acknowledge
the Pope as the head of their Church, you cannot prevent his having
spiritual influence over those who belong to that communion.'</p>

<p>This speech, which is equally sensible and true, and the really practical
view of the subject, gives a complete answer to the present agitation, and to
those who are clamouring for acts of vigour and for restrictive or prohibitory
laws. It is fruitless now to search into the animus or the objects of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
Pope. He was ill-advised, ignorant of the state of feeling and opinion here;
his pretensions were extravagant, and his hierarchy was proclaimed in an
ostentatious and offensive manner. But, granting all this, and admitting
our indignation to be called for, the question still recurs, 'What is it we can
do?' It is easy to determine what we cannot do. We cannot compel the
Pope to rescind his brief. We cannot prevent the bishops from exercising
their functions within the precise limits of the jurisdictions severally assigned
to them. We cannot undo territorial circumscriptions which have no tangible
character, and which are nothing but local designations indicative of a
defined sphere of spiritual action.  We cannot abrogate the spiritual
allegiance which the whole Roman Catholic hierarchy bear to the Pope, nor
obstruct the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, in which freedom,
if it is to be perfect, its episcopal constitution must be included. The people
of England, to do them justice, in the utmost heat of their resentment, have
evinced no disposition to violate the principle of religious liberty, and all
suggestions of returning to penal laws against the Roman Catholics have
been invariably repudiated. Well, then, if we cannot do any of these things,
what is left for us to do? We are told that the Pope may, indeed, make
bishops, but that he need not have sent any here, and that he has sent too
many; and, again, that, though he might appoint bishops, he could not
appoint dioceses over which they were to preside. But the Pope himself
can alone judge of the necessary extent of his episcopal establishment, and if
bishops are appointed at all, it is indispensable, for the mere avoidance of
confusion and disputes, that each prelate should have some local attribution,
and this can be nothing else but his diocese&mdash;the proper and only name for
the circuit of his jurisdiction. In fact, wherever there is a <i>bishopric</i> there
must be a diocese. But the Pope has not only created bishops, but has
given them titles; and this seems to be considered the head and front of his
offence, inasmuch as it is opposed to the spirit, if not to the letter of our laws,
and is an audacious assumption of a power belonging only to the sovereign
of this realm. I am very wise (as people often are) after the event, and can
clearly see that the acts of the Pope, together with the language of some in
authority under him, have been very imprudent and mischievous. But I
doubt whether I should have been so wise had I been aware of his Holiness'
intentions; for, though I should have deprecated his purpose, I certainly
should not have anticipated an outburst of popular, or rather of national
rage and resentment, which has had no parallel in England since the time of
the Popish plot. Nevertheless, if we consider the matter calmly, it must be
confessed that the Pope had some grounds for thinking that he might make
these appointments without any danger of deeply offending this country.
He had already created titular Bishops in various colonies with the concurrence
and consent of the Government; and the whole hierarchy of Ireland,
with their open assumption of the titles of their sees, had been rather more
than winked at, the law which forbids that assumption had been advisedly
suffered to be a dead letter. But besides this, in the speech of Lord John
Russell, to which I have already alluded, there was an intimation that it
would not be expedient to enter into agreements with the Pope for the
regulation of the religious arrangements of the Roman Catholics. And as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
this opinion immediately followed his dictum 'that the spiritual authority
of the Pope could only be controlled by agreement, and without any such
agreement that it must be left entirely unfettered,' I think the Pope might
not unreasonably conclude that the British Government were not inclined
to communicate with him at all on these matters, and that they preferred
leaving him to administer his ecclesiastical affairs in England according to
his own discretion. I have ever been very strongly of opinion that the true
policy of England, with her 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 of Roman Catholics,
would be to communicate with the Pope as other Powers do, and to concert
with the Holy See such measures as the spiritual interests of those Catholics
may appear to require. This is the practice of Prussia, and why should
it not be that of England? I believed at the time of its introduction that
the Diplomatic Relations Bill had this object in view, for it is obvious that
we never can have any important secular affairs to discuss with the Vatican,
and no need, therefore, of any diplomatic relations for merely political
purposes. But that Bill was a sham; its real character was not avowed;
and in order to make it appear that no recognition of the Pope's <i>de facto</i>
authority, even over Roman Catholics, was intended, and that we were not
going to communicate with him in his spiritual capacity, the matter was so
mismanaged that the Bill itself has been totally inoperative, and the Pope
himself was offended instead of being conciliated by the transaction. The
Lords began by a puerile and pedantic denial of his title as 'the Pope' or
the 'Sovereign Pontiff,' and would only consent to call him 'Sovereign of
the Roman State,' and this was followed up by the foolish clause prohibiting
an ecclesiastic from coming here as ambassador. It was as notorious as the
sun at noonday, that we had long been in communication with the Pope,
upon ecclesiastical affairs, in an underhand and clandestine manner, which
was equally undignified and unsatisfactory. All statesmen, particularly
those who governed Ireland, were anxious that regular and open relations
should be substituted, and such was the desire of the Roman Catholics and
of the Pope. Between the niceness of some and the timidity or indifference
of others, this project of conciliation and practical utility fell to the ground,
and the nation is now convulsed by a paroxysm of wrath and indignation at
measures which, if they had been concerted with our Government, and
arranged in a spirit of liberality and good will, might have been carried into
effect without giving umbrage to the most zealous Protestant or any
semblance of invading the prerogative of the Queen. However, all this is
gone by. Instead of conciliation and agreement, we are employed in vilifying
and caricaturing the Pope, burning him and the Sacred College in effigy,
and heaping execrations on the Roman Catholic religion. The great City
of London is going up in solemn procession to lay at the foot of the Throne
its superfluous protestations of allegiance, its fanciful complaints of injury,
and its vague demands for redress. And how is redress to be obtained?
After so much has been <i>said</i>, what is to be <i>done</i>? 'Ay, there's the rub!'</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANTI-PAPAL AGITATION.</div>

<p>We cannot touch the Pope himself and we cannot unfrock his Bishops.
To wage war with the dioceses would be to fight the empty air; to put any
restraint on the Roman Catholic Clergy would be religious persecution: this
all men eschew. Nothing that I know of remains, nothing at least that is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
accessible and tangible, but to make a legislative attack on the episcopal
titles, either by an extension of the existing law or the enactment of a new
one. This would, indeed, be but a lame and impotent conclusion to an
agitation which has shaken the isle from its propriety; and before we proceed
to break such flies upon the wheels of legislation, it would be advisable
to consider what the thing is we are to attack, and what has already been
done in reference to the very same matter. People talk of the Pope's
making a Bishop of Birmingham as if it was just the same thing as the
Queen's making a Bishop of London; forgetting that while the Queen
bestows rank, peerage, wealth, authority, and innumerable legal privileges
and immunities, the Pope confers nothing but his own delegated authority
to a priest to govern spiritually those individuals within a specified and
geographical limit who may be willing to submit themselves to his government,
and this geographical limit being marked out for an ecclesiastical
purpose only, and placed under the supervision of a Bishop, is called according
to canonical custom a diocese. But the Pope's Bishop has no revenues,
and in the eye of the law no authority, no privilege, no immunity whatever;
the law recognises in him no power, he has no power, he has no Court
into which he can cite offenders even of his own persuasion. He may be
arrested for debt and tried by juries like any other citizen. Bishop of
Birmingham he is and will be, in spiritual communion with the Roman
Catholics of his diocese; but if Dr. Ullathorne should attempt to assume
that title in the ordinary intercourse of society, he would expose himself to
merited contempt, and though the Roman Catholics may acknowledge it, no
Protestant will.</p>

<p>The Irish Roman Catholic Bishops all sign their Christian and surnames,
and so entirely have time and the gradual softening of sectarian acrimony
in Ireland moulded apparently irreconcileable rights and claims into harmonious
custom, that while even official documents speak of 'the Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Dublin,' that same prelate is content to be everywhere
received and to call himself 'Archbishop Murray.' All this is the
fruit of mutual but tacit concession and a sincere desire for 'peace and goodwill.'
Not many years ago Dr. MacHale on some occasion or other subscribed
himself 'John Tuam,' and an angry interpellation was addressed to Lord
Melbourne (then Premier), to know whether Her Majesty's Government
meant to prosecute this violation of the law. Lord Melbourne replied that
the Government had considered the matter, and, exercising their own discretion,
they did not think it expedient to make an appeal to the law. This
prudent decision excited the indignation of the opposite benches, but the
Duke of Wellington, with his usual good sense and superiority to party
motives, rebuked the zeal of his followers and approved of the forbearance
of the Government. What practical mischief resulted from the fact of the
Irish prelates taking the titles of their sees? and would it have been better to
indict Dr. MacHale, and that he should have been either acquitted by a jury,
or convicted in a penalty of 100<i>l.</i>, and perhaps imprisoned for refusing to
pay the fine? If it was not expedient to enforce the old law then, would
it be advisable to do so now, or to ask Parliament for fresh laws? Is it fit
to invoke that mighty power merely to repel an impertinence?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANTI-PAPAL AGITATION.</div>

<p>I well know how perilous it is to attempt to throw cold water on the
fire of popular wrath, but no such consideration shall deter me from speaking
out what I believe to be the sober truth. I think the character of my
countrymen, and their reputation all over the world, and in after ages,
much more in jeopardy than their religion. Indeed, it is not without a
feeling of shame that I see the pusillanimous terror of Popery which is so
often and openly proclaimed. What, when we Protestants form nineteen out
of twenty out of the population, with an incalculable superiority of wealth,
influence, and learning, a richly endowed Church, all the great seminaries
of education, almost the whole of the aristocracy, a vast preponderance of
public opinion, and, above all, with reason, truth, and the Bible on our side,
are we afraid of the Roman Catholics? and can we not defy the open efforts
or the secret machinations of the Romish hierarchy? Let me not, however,
be misunderstood. Although I think the prevailing agitation exaggerated,
and far more than commensurate with the cause which has
excited it, I do not think it unnatural or unreasonable in its origin, and notwithstanding
the apology for the Pope, of which the scope of my arguments
necessarily presents the appearance, I join in the general condemnation
which his proceedings have elicited. They exhibit rashness, want of
courtesy to the Crown, and want of consideration for the feelings of the
people of England. It is impossible to expect men to distinguish accurately
or to reason calmly when the passions are roused; and all the odious or
offensive matter scattered through briefs, pastoral letters, and Popish
sermons have been confounded together into one cumulative case against
the Pope and the Roman Catholic Faith. The flourish of trumpets, the
songs of triumph, the vain boasting with which those measures were proclaimed,
justify a large amount of disgust and indignation; but the real
injury which the honour and the policy of England are required to redress
bears in my mind but a small proportion to the false assumptions and ridiculous
pretensions which we might well afford to regard with a scornful
indifference. I do not, indeed, believe that the Pope intended to insult the
Queen, because such conduct would be inconsistent alike with his character
and his interest; but he ought to have taken more pains than he did, even
for the sake of the English Catholics, to ascertain how his measures would
be received, and still more, to be careful that their introduction was divested
of every suspicious circumstance and offensive detail. Whatever may have
been his motives, he has cast a firebrand into this country, and been the
primary cause of a conflagration which time and great prudence and moderation
alone can quench. I cannot help looking beyond the present hour, and
regarding with horror the prospect of a chronic state of religious discord
and sectarian hatred. All men deprecate the renewal of penal laws, but at
the same time express a vague and undefined longing to have <i>something</i>
done. It is said, that if we do nothing we shall give the Catholics a
triumph; but we shall surely give them a much greater triumph if by some
piece of peddling and abortive legislation we should have the appearance of
being willing without having the power to strike them. I cannot conclude
without expressing the deep regret with which I have read denunciations of
the Roman Catholic Church, in language which is not that of humility, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
charity, or peace; nor do I think that it becomes the members of a Church,
which admits its own fallibility, thus dogmatically to condemn the belief of
the great majority of the Christian world.</p>

He endeavoured to tranquillise me about the information to Thiers,

[Henry, Lord Cowley, younger brother of the Duke of Wellington
(born 1773), had been Ambassador at the Court of France under the late
Government. He resigned on the fall of Sir Robert Peel's Administration,
but remained as a private gentleman in Paris until his death, which took
place in April 1847, shortly after this interview.]</p></div>

Miraflores came to Paris for (see <i>post</i>) the purpose of getting something
settled. He told the King that Trapani was out of the question, the two
sons of Don Francisco de Paula almost impossible from the Queen's dislike
of both, especially of Don Enrique, on account of his insolent letter to her
from Bayonne. If, therefore, His Majesty would not give them his own son,
he entreated him to leave them alone and let them choose for themselves.
The King answered very angrily, said he would not give the Duke de
Montpensier, still urged one of the Spanish Princes, but above all recommended
delay, and to take time for consideration. This Miraflores told to
Lord Cowley, who wrote it home to Palmerston. This is the communication
which Palmerston alludes to in his long note, but he is very incorrect in
his allusion.</p></div>

[Louis Philippe was certainly not wanting in physical courage, but in
moral courage he appeared in his later years to be deficient. M. Thiers was
in the habit of using exaggerated language, and he disliked the King; for
M. Thiers' great defect was that he could not <i>serve</i> anyone. The Revolution
of February 1848 proved that there was a good deal of truth in these
predictions. But the want of resolution which M. Thiers imputed to the
King arose solely from his honourable and consistent aversion to violence and
war.]</p></div>

[The effect of the quarrel arising out of the Queen of Spain's marriage,
and the squabble between M. Guizot and Lord Normanby, began to bear
fatal consequences on the politics of Europe. The amicable relations which
had subsisted between France and England until Lord Palmerston returned
to power were at an end. Lord Normanby, though ostensibly reconciled to
M. Guizot, remained in close alliance with M. Thiers and the leaders of the
French Opposition, and his efforts to overthrow the Government to which
he was accredited contributed to the overthrow of the Monarchy. M.
Guizot, at variance with the English Minister of foreign affairs, and
assailed by the English Ambassador in Paris, drew nearer to the policy of the
Northern Courts, and especially of Prince Metternich. Such were the signs
of the approaching tempest which broke over Europe in the following year.]</p></div>

fleet entered the Tagus to support the Queen. The contest continued for
some months, and in May 1847 a conference was held in London between
the representatives of Great Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal&mdash;the
original parties to the Quadruple alliance&mdash;to settle the disorders which had
broken out in the last-mentioned kingdom.]</p></div>

[About this time the proposal was made, chiefly by Sir Frederic
Trench, to place the equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington (by
Wyatt) on the top of the archway opposite Apsley House. Most people
thought that it was absurd and in bad taste to place a statue there. It
was, however, agreed to erect it provisionally; but, once there, the
Duke showed great irritation at the idea of removing it, which he
declared would be an indignity: so there the statue stood until it was
removed to Aldershot in 1884. It was the first instance of an equestrian
statue erected in London to a subject.]</p></div>

[Dr. Hampden, who was accused of heterodox opinions, and whose
appointment to a Canonry at Oxford had already occasioned an explosion of
bigotry and intolerance in the Church, was raised to the See of Hereford by
Lord John Russell, chiefly, as it would seem, as an act of defiance to the
Clerical party. Hampden was a dull, heavy man, who made more noise in

the Court of Queen's Bench, for a mandamus against the Archbishop of
Canterbury. Judgement was given on February 1. Mr. Justice Coleridge

taken up the question of the Spanish Marriages with extreme warmth. He
it was who mainly disinterred and relied upon the renunciations annexed to
the Treaty of Utrecht, which were designed to exclude any other branch of
the House of Bourbon from the Spanish throne. Lord Palmerston adopted
these arguments, but without effect, as, indeed, the whole state of Europe
had changed; and Lord John Russell never thought there was much weight
in them. Lord William Hervey was a highly accomplished and honourable
diplomatist, third son of the Marquis of Bristol. His health was bad, and
he died in May 1850, at the age of forty-five.]</p></div>

Philippe from Claremont, although it was not even an English royal palace
at that time, but belonged to the King's own son-in-law, Leopold, King of
the Belgians. Lord Palmerston's design was signally defeated, and only
excited the disgust of all those who knew the circumstances; but it was
characteristic of his virulent personal animosity to the Orleans family, which,
indeed, appears to have dated from a much earlier period, even before the
Restoration in 1815.]</p></div>

to the Queen of Spain that she would do well to change her Government.
Sir Henry not only communicated this despatch to Queen Christina and the
Duc de Sotomayor, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but caused it to be
published in the Opposition journals. The Spanish Government returned
the despatch with a haughty answer. Lord Palmerston, however, approved
the conduct of Sir H. Bulwer, and the consequence was that on May 19 the
British Minister was ordered to leave Spain in forty-eight hours.]</p></div>

He asked a great many questions about these invisible personages, to the
amusement of all the Newmarket world. At last it was evident he
must find out the truth, and I urged George to tell it him at once. With
reluctance and no small apprehension he assented, and mustering up
courage he told the Duke that all those horses were his. The intimation
was very ill received; the Duke was indignant. He accused him of having
violated his word; and he was so angry that he instantly quitted Newmarket
and returned to Welbeck. For a long time he would not see George
at all; at last the Duchess contrived to pacify him; he resumed his usual
habits with his son, and in the end he took an interest in the horses, tacitly
acquiesced in the whole thing, and used to take pleasure in seeing them and

with the Serjeant, and would gladly have taken him, but, after at first consenting,
the Serjeant drew back and declined the task. After this, Martin
asked Frederick Robinson if he knew of a man, when he replied, 'It is all

you think the House of Commons would listen to a hired orator, brought
down for the purpose? They will listen to him and to nobody else.' This
Martin repeated to him, telling him it was very true; and then he added
what I had said about his speech at the Jockey Club. He said, 'Did he

Seal himself. Lord Lansdowne told him the Government must be <i>his</i>

he had no disposition for it, and he would rather take some other office.
When Lord Grey retired, and the King sent for Melbourne, Melbourne
spoke to Lord Lansdowne and said, 'I believe you do not wish to take Lord
Grey's place, is not that the case?' Lord Lansdowne said it was so, and
that he might make himself quite easy as far as he was concerned. He had

the French Government at the measures taken at Athens became so great
that General Lahitte, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, recalled M. Drouyn
de Lhuys from London shortly afterwards, as will be seen below.]</p></div>

[An unlucky prediction! As it seems that this wild scheme was communicated
to me, I must be allowed to add that I never for an instant

which was already within his grasp.&mdash;H. R.]</p></div>

[On June 17 Lord Stanley made his motion in the House of Lords
censuring the Government for their coercive measures against the commerce
and people of Greece, in a speech of extraordinary eloquence and power.
The debate lasted all night. As morning dawned the division resulted in a
majority of 37 against Ministers.]</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">122</a>
[Mr. Roebuck moved a resolution applauding the principles which
have hitherto regulated the foreign policy of the Government, to countervail
the recent vote of the Lords. A great and memorable debate followed,
in which Lord Palmerston delivered his ablest speech, and Sir Robert Peel
his last. The debate ended by a Ministerial majority of 46, so that, for the
time, the supporters of Lord Palmerston were completely victorious; yet in
that majority a large number of votes were given by those who most condemned
his high-handed proceedings.]</p></div>

[In spite of the triumph Lord Palmerston had obtained in the House
of Commons, the evils of his arbitrary mode of conducting-foreign affairs
continued to excite the anxiety of his colleagues and something more than
the distrust of the Court, and an attempt was made, with the concurrence
of Lord John Russell, the Duke of Bedford, Lord Lansdowne, and Lord
Clarendon, to induce him to take some other office in the Government,
which, of course, he declined to do. The details of this negotiation cannot
now be published, but they were the premonitory symptoms of the storm
which wrested the Foreign Office from the hands of Lord Palmerston in the
following year.]</p></div>

Majesty laid down the rules which ought to govern the conduct of the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and intimated that a departure from
them 'must be considered as failing in sincerity towards the Crown, and
justly to be visited by the exercise of her constitutional right of dismissing
that Minister,' bore date August 12, 1850, and was communicated to Lord
Palmerston by Lord John Russell at this time, within a few weeks of the
termination of the debate on the foreign policy of the Government.]</p></div>

[The German question relates to the proceedings which had arisen out
of the Frankfort Convention, the Schleswig-Holstein quarrel, and the dispute
in Hesse, which nearly led to war. Lord Palmerston was strongly opposed
to the views taken by the Court on these German questions.]</p></div>

[H.R.H. Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, youngest surviving son of
George III., died in July 1850, and was succeeded by his son, Prince George
of Cambridge. A question arose as to his precedence; but H.R.H. sits in
the House of Lords as fourth Peer of the Blood Royal, the Duke of Cumberland
not having taken the seat to which he has an hereditary right.]</p></div>

[Upon the death of William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, his brother,
Frederic Lamb, previously created Lord Beauvale, succeeded to the Melbourne
title and to the Brocket and other estates. Lord Beauvale had
married at Vienna, where he was British Minister, Mdlle. de Maltzahn,
daughter of the Prussian Minister at that Court. Mr. Greville was much
more intimate with Frederic, than he had ever been with William, Lamb,
and he continued, during the remainder of Lord Beauvale's life, to be a
frequent guest at Brocket. He generally called his friend by his former
name or title, though he was, in fact, Viscount Melbourne after his brother's
death.]</p></div>

his death.]</p></div>

[It was on the 22nd of February that Lord John Russell moved the
postponement of the Committee of Ways and Means, which implied his intention
to resign, though it was not generally understood to have that meaning.
An interesting and accurate account of this transaction is to be found in a
letter from Lord Canning to Lord Malmesbury in the first volume of Lord
Malmesbury's Journal, p. 274.]</p></div>

[Lord Malmesbury gives an account of the failure of Lord Stanley to
form a Government in his Journals (vol. i. p. 278), which was mainly due
to the timid conduct of Mr. Henley and Mr. Herries. Mr. Disraeli did not
conceal his anger at the want of courage and interest shown by those persons.
They may, however, have had better reasons for refusing to join a Protectionist
Cabinet.]</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">132</a>
[Lord Stanley said of this speech of Graham's that it was very bitter

for from the leading Peelites but opposition.]</p></div>

[The details of this negotiation between the Whigs, Lord Aberdeen
and Sir James Graham, have been published in an article on the 'Correspondence
of Lord Aberdeen,' which appeared in the 'Edinburgh Review'
for October 1883. The insurmountable objections of the Peelites to the
Anti-Papal Bill was the deciding cause of the failure; but the transaction
is interesting, because it was the forerunner of the Coalition ultimately formed
between the Whigs and the Peelites in 1852.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="label">134</a>
[In the negotiations with the Peelites, Lord John Russell had offered
to reduce the provisions of the 'Ecclesiastical Titles Bill' to a minimum,
and to omit the preamble. It was impossible for him, after what had passed,
to withdraw it altogether.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_135" href="#FNanchor_135" class="label">135</a>
[It is a remarkable proof of the candid and dispassionate spirit of the
Queen, that the three men who, at different times and for different reasons,
were notoriously the objects of her distrust and aversion, subsequently
obtained, as First Ministers of the Crown, her entire confidence. Sir Robert
Peel was no favourite at the time of his abortive attempt to succeed Lord
Melbourne in 1839. Lord Palmerston was entirely at variance with the
Court whilst he held the seals of the Foreign Office. And Mr. Disraeli was
supposed to be especially disliked. Yet in the higher office of Prime
Minister each of these statesmen enjoyed the confidence and approval of the
Sovereign, and carried on the Government with success for several years.
None, certainly, ever received higher marks of favour and distinction than
have been bestowed, in life and in death, on Sir Robert Peel and Lord
Beaconsfield.]</p></div>

[This transaction, which was little known at the time and is now forgotten,
derives importance from the events which followed, and which led
to Lord Palmerston's expulsion from the Cabinet. The proximate cause of
that rupture was his unauthorised approval of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> in France
on December 2. But that incident was only the crowning incident of a
long series of disputes recorded in these pages, which had rendered Lord
Palmerston's autocracy in the Foreign Office alike intolerable to the Court
and to his colleagues.]</p></div>

as Foreign Secretary was to appoint the second Lord Cowley in his place.

which Palmerston, who was burning with a desire to revenge himself for
his dismissal, moved an amendment, which he carried against the
Government by a majority of nine. On this John Russell resigned, and
Lord Derby was sent for. The resignation of the Russell Government was
announced to both Houses on the 23rd, and Lord Derby's first exposition
of policy as Prime Minister was made on February 27.]</p></div>

insertion of a clause, 'That any person who shall serve in the Militia for
two years shall be entitled to a vote in the county in which he resides.'
This proposal excited a good deal of ridicule, and was subsequently withdrawn.
The Militia Bill passed the House of Commons on June 7th, and
the House of Lords on the 21st of the same month.]</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
